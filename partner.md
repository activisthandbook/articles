## How you can help us
Your organisation or movement can help make the Activist Handbook project a success in the following ways:
- **📝 Write or crosspost articles:** Maybe you already have some guides for activists that you would like to share with a larger audience. Or perhaps people in your organisation can share their experiences and knowledge in new articles.
- **📢 Tell your community about us:** Promote us on your social media and newsletter, share our partnership on your website, share our articles with your members, mention us during events, etc.
- **💰 Financial contribution:** No matter how small, any financial contribution is appreciated and will help us train more rebels.
- **📆 Host events together:** By co-hosting events like training sessions, we will be able to learn from each other and our communities will get to know each other better.
- **💪 Provide organisational support:** Maybe your organisation has lots of experience building up movements, applying for funding or working on large projects. Your advice can help us work more effectively.

## How we can help you
Our amazing volunteers are happy to assist your movement in becoming more effective at change-making. Here is how we can help you:
- **📕 Use our platform for internal guides:** To host our website, make use of Wiki.js, an open source software suite specifically developed for knowledge-sharing. Your movement can also make use of this platform to share internal guides for your volunteers.
- **🙋‍♀️ Request articles:** Tell us what you would like to learn more about, so that we know what topics our community is interested in. Our content circle will do research and write guides based on the input you give.
- **🎓 Get training from our volunteers:** We regularly host events where members of our community share their experiences and knowledge. These trainings are always free to join. Our event circle is happy to hear what your organisation would like to be trained in.
- **📖 Access our 200+ community-writen articles:** All our articles are free to access. Allow your volunteers to work more effectively by giving them access to the largest activism library available online.

# Our principles
We are here for social, progressive and green rebels all over the globe. We believe that effective change-making is all about empowering marginalised communities and providing people with the right tools and training.

To formulate these core ideas, we wrote a set of [principles](/en/about/principles). We only work together with organisations and movements that align with these principles.
