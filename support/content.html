<h1><strong>About this circle</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Welcome to the Content Circle, the place where the activists become writers and researchers. The idea of our circle is peer to peer education, so ideally we want to make sure that what we write is not only accurate, but also relevant and useful to activists from all over the world.</p>
<p>We also intend to facilitate the cooperation between writers and help them find partners or teams for co-writing. We strongly believe in working together, sharing knowledge, resources and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
