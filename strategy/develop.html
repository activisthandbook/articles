<p>We have written several articles to help you write a strategy for your movement. We have added step-by-step guides for organising workshop sessions to start writing a strategy together with fellow rebels.</p>
<h2><strong>Templates &amp; workgroup guides</strong></h2>
<p>There is no “one right way” to capture and communicate all the elements of strategy. &nbsp;Some organisations have a preference for simple one-page tables. Others use longly narrative formats or complex documents that extend to 20 pages or more. &nbsp;Some templates we’ve seen used effectively are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-strategy-chart/"><strong>tCA strategy chart</strong></a>: The anatomy of a campaign strategy: a chart illustrating elements of strategy and processes your group can use to develop them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-campaign-strategy-template/"><strong>tCA campaign strategy template</strong></a>: a template incorporating elements of strategy and suggested processes to develop each element with members of your group</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/basic-strategy-grid/"><strong>Basic strategy grid</strong></a>: An adapted version of the Midwest Academy’s community organising grid, this simple table provides one way of developing and integrating key pieces of a strategy in a logical sequence.</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-strategy-grid/"><strong>tCA strategy grid</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/strategic-planning-template-2/"><strong>Strategic planning template</strong></a>: This format has been used by medium-sized environment groups in their annual planning cycle. A simple table requiring vision, objectives, resources and performance indicators. The table is also useful for evaluation purposes.</li>
