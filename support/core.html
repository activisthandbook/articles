<p>Congratulations, you are now a member of the core team! We will schedule a video call with you to help you get started in your new role. The guides below will help you further.</p>
<p>We have a few articles that are useful for all members of the core circle. In addition, you will find guides below specifically written for your role.</p>

<h1><strong>Digital security for activists</strong></h1>
<p>Groups working on social/racial justice, environmental, immigration and refugee issues, as well as gender and reproductive rights are being targeted by hackers/trolls that are intent on subverting their work for political reasons.</p>
<p>You should protect yourself from hackers. As activist, you are in a high risk group. Digital security practices help protect campaigners from malicious online attacks and intrusive surveillance efforts led either by groups that are hostile to your agenda or by repressive government agencies.</p>
