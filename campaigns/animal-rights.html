<p><strong>The animal rights movement is vast and diverse. It covers a wide variety of causes from liberating animals in captivity to changing dietary habits. This page covers how to organise for animal rights.</strong></p>
<p>In the guide you will find some tips and relevant resources on how to get started as animal rights activist. For example, check out our article about how to <a href="/organising/action">organise a protest or demonstration</a>. We also have a chapter that will help you to <a href="/communication">speak up</a> about this issue online and in the media</p>
<p>Most groups rely on volunteers to carry out their work, all with busy lives next to their activist lives, so it is important to <a href="/wellbeing">take care of your fellow rebels</a> and avoid burnout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many ways to contribute to the animal rights moment, from organising actions to <a href="/organising/finance">fundraising</a> to promoting the group online. We recommend you find something you are good at, and get together a larger group of people with a diverse set of skills.</p>
<p>However, you do not have to limit yourself to what you already have experience with. Activism is always a learning process. If you're looking for training, then consider joining a <a href="/trainings">workshop</a> offered by experienced campaigners.&nbsp;</p>
