<p><strong>In this guide, we will help you to get started as a content moderator. If you are already a content moderator, we encourage you to edit this guide to make it fit better with your working style. This will help both you and your successor!&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>Your role</h1>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> As content moderator, your domain are the <a href="/en/support/content/moderate">moderation guidelines</a>. You make these guidelines in accordance with the principles of Activist Handbook and make sure the content on our website is written within these guidelines. You are also responsible to react to reports and flags made by the visitors of Activist Handbook, and the improvement of flagged content.</p>

<h1>Moderation isn't policing</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Guidelines are not</strong> law and order. They exist to frame content in a way which is aligned with the purpose and style of Activist Handbook. Diversity of thought is an important principle and we want to make sure it's represented in our content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The guidelines could use some brushing up, they are really out of date and a lot of the content relevant to moderation is currently a part of the <a href="/en/support/content/write">writing guidelines</a>. We are working on fixing this.</p>
<h1>Inclusivity and diversity</h1>
<p>Activist Handbook is built on the principle of horizontal self-governance. We want to be sensitive to diverse groups of potential users. When writing moderation guidelines, make sure to check in with our Inclusivity Facilitator.</p>
