<p>When writing articles, we might want to explain certain concepts, use of words, or stress a caveat. You can use either asterisk (*) or numbers (1) (2) … (n) in case you will be using multiple footnotes. The related footnotes are placed at the bottom of the main article, before chapters and other links in the section titled “Footnotes”. Examples can be found in the articles <a href="/en/getting-started"><i>Introduction </i></a>and <a href="/en/wellbeing/riot-medicine/field-guide"><i>Riot Medicine.</i></a></p>
<p>When quoting external resources such as papers, articles, videos or podcasts we use the following format</p>
<p><strong>Name of the content, [language, type of content] by Author (year of publication)</strong></p>
<p>Link to the original content are placed within the name of the content. The references are placed at the very bottom of the article, after the footnotes and other links, in the section titled “References”. Examples can be found in the article <a href="/en/getting-started"><i>Introduction</i></a>.</p>
<h1>Captioning illustrations</h1>
<p>Illustrations are integral parts of most of our articles. They can be pulled directly&nbsp;from resources or from one of the free libraries. We have a section on the website dedicated to <a href="/en/tools/photo-video">free libraries of illustrations for activists</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you add an illustration you will be given an option to edit the captions at the bottom. We recommend the following format of the caption:</p>
<p><strong>Title of the illustration (<u>with a link to the original artwork</u>), Author (year of publication).</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Examples of this type of captioning can be found in the article <a href="/en/organising/start-a-movement"><i>Start a movement</i></a>.</p>
<h1>Adding resources</h1>
<p>The first step when writing a new article is to collect resources. Resources can be external articles, books, movies, and more. Here are a few tips when collecting resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make clear what kind of resource it is</strong> by adding the type between brackets after the title like so: <i>Title Of Resource <u>[movie/video/book]</u></i></li>
  <li><strong>Make clear what in what language(s) the resource is available</strong> when it is in a different language than the page it is on. Add it between brackets after the title like so: <i>Titel Van Artikel <u>[Deutch/Nederlands]</u></i></li>
  <li><strong>Make sure to archive the resource. </strong>This way, even if the original link breaks (for example, when the link changes or the page is deleted), users will still be able to access the resource. Use <a href="https://web.archive.org">web.archive.org</a> to archive web pages.</li>
</ul>
