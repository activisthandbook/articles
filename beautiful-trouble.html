<p><strong>Beautiful Trouble is a collection of over 300 stories, </strong><a href="/tactics"><strong>tactics</strong></a><strong>, principles, </strong><a href="/theory"><strong>theories</strong></a><strong> and methodologies for activists. You can also order the toolkit for troublemakers in book form. Also make sure to check out other </strong><a href="/resources"><strong>resources for activists</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://beautifultrouble.org/toolbox/">Beautiful Trouble</a> platform is about making it easier for people to take creative action for social justice. They provide accessible <a href="/tools">tools</a> and training that help movements become more creative, effective and sustainable, showing the beauty in activism. Like Activist Handbook, their approach is based on shared leadership, modified consensus-based decision making, anti-oppression politics, and international and intersectional solidarity.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Beautiful Trouble organisation published the <strong>Beautiful Rising book</strong> in collaboration with activists from the Global South. Afterwards, they updated their website with all the new knowledge assembled in that book.</p>
<h1>Training for activists</h1>
<p>No-one is born an activist. If you would like to learn more about social change-making, make sure to check out their training programme. Their experienced campaigners will teach you all about protests, campaigns, and movements.</p>
<p>If you are interested in grassroots movement-building workshops offered by other organisations, make sure to check out our <a href="/trainings">list of training organisations for protestors</a>.</p>
<h1>Difference Activist Handbook and Beautiful Trouble</h1>
<p>Beautiful Trouble is an awesome resource for change-makers around the globe. At Activist Handbook, we were very much inspired by their work, especially when it comes to their efforts to get proper international representation of activists.</p>
<p>We wanted to take this a step further: by allowing anyone to edit Activist Handbook, Wikipedia-style, we lower the barrier even further for troublemakers all over the world to share their knowledge and experiences. In addition, we actively integrate existing resources with our platform, so that together we can create the most comprehensive manual for rebels â€“ available in all languages and with content adapted to local contexts.</p>
<h1>Guides published under Creative Commons Licence</h1>
<p>All guides published on the Beautiful Trouble platform are available under a Creative Commons License. This means that other people can reuse and remix their resources for troublemakers. At Activist Handbook, we use the same licence, and many of our articles are based on the ones published on Beautiful Trouble.</p>
