<p>While writing Activist Handbook, we realised that each activist community also needs their own guides that apply to their specific cause. That is why we allow these communities to add your own manuals on our website.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Let's work together!</strong> Activist Handbook is a collaborative project by activists all over the globe. We would love to <a href="/partner"><strong>partner up</strong></a> with your organisation or movement.&nbsp;</p>
