<h1>In short</h1>
<p>Real people need real practical help in their fight against injustice. They don't want to read an entertaining magazine about activists, nor do they want to do years of academic research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event is an intense, sprint-like team work activity that lasts for a limited amount of time and produces clear written outputs. <strong>At the International Rebel Assembly, we do not write articles just for the sake of writing articles. We want to bring about change.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This event will produce condensed and practical resources to support an international community of activists. The outputs will feed into the Activist Handbook, a Wikipedia-style collaborative manual for activists.</p>
