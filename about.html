<p>Activist Handbook is a Wikipedia-style collaborative manual created by activists, for activists, in <a href="/about/history">2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We <a href="/about/principles">believe</a> that knowledge should be free and available to everyone. We strive to connect globally, learn from various activist undertakings in different political and historical contexts. Cooperation, sharing, diversity and mutuality are important to us. Our organisation aims to support local communities who want to learn from activist experiences from their peers around the globe and share their invaluable experience and practices.</p>

<h1>How we work</h1>
<p>Our organisational structure is inspired by <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/">Holacracy</a>. This way we collaborate decentrally, democratically and effectively. Our organisation is flexible, currently comprising <a href="/about/logbook">six circles</a>, each with a different function. We are all <a href="/about/people">volunteers</a>, working hard to write articles about activism, make our content available in multiple languages, and connect with rebels from all over the world by hosting events and facilitating conversations.</p>
<p>Chapters on this website are available under a <a href="/about/licence">creative commons licence</a> which means that all our content is open to be distributed, edited and built upon by you. The project relies heavily on the contribution of community members and external partners for its content. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we provide an accessible platform that brings together the knowledge and experiences from activists all over the world.</p>

  <p>We‚Äôre constantly <a href="/join">looking for new members</a>, both in the core circle and in our community of contributors.&nbsp;</p>
