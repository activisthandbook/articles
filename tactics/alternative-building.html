<h1>What is alternative building?</h1>
<p>There is no one answer to this question as alternative building in activism can take many forms, depending on the specific goals and values of the activist group in question. Some common examples of alternative building in activism include creating community gardens, setting up communal living spaces, and constructing off-grid homes.</p>
<h1>About this strategy</h1>
<p>The aim of these strategies is to replace existing systems with new ones, or at least to create pockets of autonomous self-governing safe-spaces for individuals and communities. The most radical examples of the use of these strategies are seen within the autonomous provinces and municipalities such as Rojava (Autonomous Administration of Northern Syria) or one of the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities, but various types of intentional communities and communes such as Freetown Christiania in Denmark or farming communities fighting Monsanto in India use strategies that also fall under this category.</p>
