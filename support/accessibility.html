<p><strong>We want everyone to be able to contribute as a volunteer to Activist Handbook. We created this page to help you participate. If there is something we can do to become more inclusive,&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We acknowledge that the information on this page is still a bit scarce. Let us know how we can make Activist Handbook more accessible: <a href="mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org">contact@activisthandbook.org</a></p>

<h1>Language</h1>
<h2>Speaking English</h2>
<p>We speak English. Is it difficult for you to speak English? We want to help you. This is how:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Let us know you need help. </strong>You can send a message to: <a href="mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org">contact@activisthandbook.org</a></li>
  <li><strong>You can speak your own language.</strong> With <a href="https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142474?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;oco=0">Google Translate</a>, we will understand what you say.</li>
  <li><strong>People in our group may speak your language. </strong>They can talk with you and help translate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Muteness</h2>
<p>If you are mute, you can talk during our video calls by using the chat window.</p>
<h2>Deafness</h2>
<p>If you are not able to hear others speak, you can turn on <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9300310?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">live captions </a>during the video call. In addition, we make minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Sight</h1>
<p>If you cannot see or have trouble seeing, the guide on how to <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/360000411963-Use-Slack-with-a-screen-reader">use Slack with a screen reader</a> might be useful.</p>
<h1>Bad internet</h1>
<p>Do you have bad internet? You can join our video calls by <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9683440?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=7192926">calling with your phone</a> to a special number.

<h1>Timezone differences</h1>
<p>We are an international organisation, so all of us live in different timezones. Here is what we do to make our events and meetings as inclusive as possible:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We try to organise our meetings at times that work for as many people as possible (usually at 14:00 UTC, which is the evening in Asia, morning in America and late afternoon in Europe). If an event is at an inconvenient time for you, do let us know!</li>
  <li>We record all our meetings so people can watch them back later.</li>
  <li>We are setting up local circles, so you can physically meet up with volunteers of Activist Handbook in a location near you (also reducing travel costs).</li>
</ul>
