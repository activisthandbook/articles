<h1>Your role</h1>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> As resource miner your main purpose is to find resources on priority topics the Content circle is working on. Your goals are focused around external libraries, you will be updating our <a href="/en/resources">Resource page</a> and providing teams of writers with resources on topics they are working on at any moment.</p>

<h1>Managing the resource library</h1>
<p>We're aware that as the Activist Handbook grows, navigating the resource library is going to become difficult. There was a talk of using #tags in combination with pages on resource pages, but this idea is far from being actionable. We're hoping you can find a good solution.</p>
