<p>Why this resource is great:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very extensive</li>
  <li>Well organised</li>
  <li>Based on academic research</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this resource is not so great:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Focussed on local communities, but overlooks bigger systemic issues. Almost all strategies proposed focus on making a difference locally. While this is great for people who want to make a direct impact, it doesn't bring us closer to something like radically overhauling our toxic capitalist society.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
