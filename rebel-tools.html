<h1><strong>Alternative for Action Network</strong></h1>
<p>How does <a href="https://rebel.tools/campaigns/actionnetwork">Action Network</a> compare to Rebel Tools? While Action Network offers more advanced tools to organise large activist networks, Rebel Tools is more intuitive to use for small to medium sized movements. A major benefit is that small movements get access to all features for free. Another difference is that Rebel Tools is open source.</p>
<h1>More tools for activists</h1>
<p>Obviously we like Rebel Tools, because we built it ourselves. However, every movement has different needs. That is why we write guides for how to use other digital tools as well. You can find these in our <a href="/tools">tools chapter</a>.</p>
