<p><strong>In this chapter, you will learn how to transform a group of individuals into a powerful movement. We will talk about how you can build capacity to make impact, how to facilitate a welcoming atmosphere for everyone, and how to set up an organisational structure for decision making.</strong></p>

<h1>Capacity building</h1>
<p>You want to make a big impact. But you have a limited access to resources needed to get there. This section focusses on building capacity to bring about change.</p>
<p>Learn how to increase the number of people in your organisation, through activating supporters (mobilisation), activating non-supporters (recruitment), and keeping your activists active (engagement).</p>
<p>Learn how to grow knowledge in your members (training), grow the knowledge in your organisation (organisational learning), and manage that knowledge in a systemic way (knowledge management).</p>

<h1>Organisation structure</h1>
<p>As your movement grows, you will likely find it becomes harder to make decisions quickly. You might lose track of who is responsible for certain tasks. You may lose motivation, because your goals seem so far out of reach. Setting up a good movement structure can help your organise better.</p>
<p>Do not reinvent the wheel: other movements have tried out many different ways of organising. Use the following frameworks to get inspired:</p>

  <li><a href="sos"><strong>Self-Organising-System</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="scrum"><strong>Scrum</strong></a></li>
