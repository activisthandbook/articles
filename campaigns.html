<p><strong>At Activist Handbook, we do not just write articles for the sake of writing articles. We want to achieve change. In this chapter, instead of organising our content based on topics related to activism in general, we organise our content based on causes.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>By organising our content based on causes, we make it easier for activists to find our handbook. People usually tend to look up cause-related search terms, so with these landing pages we make sure get to the high quality content, without having to know exactly what to search for.</p>
