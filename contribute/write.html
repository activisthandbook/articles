<h1>Writing Guidelines</h1>
<p>These guidelines are a working document that should constantly evolve. <strong>Please suggest changes!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Suggest changes as a comment at the bottom of the page.</li>
  <li>Add a new section that you think is important.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Original Research</strong></h2>
<p>Original content is used to mean anything that is published<i><strong> for the first time </strong></i>on<i> Activist Handbook,</i> which therefore does not exist previously anywhere else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The primary aim of<i> Activist Handbook</i> is to research, collect, categorise and share information useful to activists, by making it available and easy for consultation all in one place. Material that has <strong>already been published</strong> through publications, toolkits, on other organisations’ websites etc will therefore be the priority focus of content uploaded on and shared through the Activist Handbook’s website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, unlike Wikipedia, Activist Handbook might in the future allow the publication of original research. For example, AH could carry on its own research in the future by running surveys among the activists and organisations with specific targets, and finally publishing the results.</p>
<h2><strong>Conflict of interest</strong></h2>
<p>Unlike Wikipedia, for example, we encourage contributors to write about topics they are close to. For example, we believe that people of a particular marginalised identity are the best people to write about making activism accessible for their communities. Also, activists in a particular organisation are the people best placed to write about that organisation.</p>
<p>However, we should also be wary of the effect of being close to a subject we are writing about. For example, members of a particular organisation should be wary of unduly promoting that organisation when writing about them. When you’re writing, ask yourself, would this perspective be controversial in a circle of activists from other progressive organisations? If so, present their perspectives too.</p>
<h2>Personal experience</h2>
<p>The Activist Handbook values personal experiences of activists and strives to gradually create a space where activists benefit through a peer-to-peer exchange process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personal experience is however subjective and anecdotal. This is in clear contrast with information which is objective and factual. The two types of information should therefore be well signaled, and differentiated from one another, on the website. It should be clearly stated what is factual (and what are the sources) and what is anecdotal (and who is sharing that piece of experience). For the latter, a disclaimer could be used to say that this doesn’t necessarily reflect AH’s opinion.</p>
<p>A specific place where to collect personal experience of activists should be created, either at the end of each page of content (if related to a particular topic/tool/method etc.) or in a separate space on the website (could be a blog-style space).</p>
<h2>Personal opinions</h2>
<p><i>Activist Handbook</i> recognizes the importance of the personal opinions of activists who are and are not a member of the AH to create a dialogue and share their opinions of activism in their region. We recognize that the opinions published on our website and shared throughout our social media that those opinions do not reflect the overall Activist Handbook as a community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also recognise that some level of opinion is impossible to avoid when writing. For example, we are all of the opinion that activism is a good way to make change. However, when writing articles which are not explicitly opinion pieces, we should be wary to include a range of opinions from within our community of progressive activists. These can be introduced with examples from organisations who hold these opinions. What we should avoid is writing our own opinion within pieces which are not explicitly opinion pieces, when that opinion may not be shared by the activist community.</p>
<p><i>Activist Handbook</i> is a diverse group of people involved in all forms of progressive activism that come from all around the world who wish to share their personal opinions about activism. To submit and publish personal opinions on our website is to ensure free speech and to ensure the voice of progressive activists are listened to, heard and acted upon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The members of the content team decided on the 2020-06-25 that we discussed and agreed that personal opinions of activism should be published on the AH, but that, similar to personal experiences (see above), it should be clearly separate when somebody is talking about their own opinions</p>
<h2>Commonly used terms</h2>
<p>When you use a term that is used repeatedly across the website and might need explained, you can hyperlink to a page explaining what it means. For example, this is how it looks for the term <a href="https://activisthandbook.org/en/anti-oppression">anti-oppression practice</a>. You can find term pages that already exist on the page for pages tagged “terms”: https://activisthandbook.org/t/terms</p>
<p>If a page for the term you are using does not exist yet, you can create one by adding a new page a using the tag “terms”.</p>
<p>Separate tags using an identical concept exist for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Resources: https://activisthandbook.org/t/resources<ul>
      <li>Books: https://activisthandbook.org/t/books</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Note, all pages explaining a resource should be tagged <strong>both</strong> with the “resources” tag and the format of resource that they are (e.g. “books”).</p>
<h1>Basic guidelines</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Texts should be simple to read.</strong> Many visitors of this site are non-native English speakers. Short sentences are better than long ones, and simple words are better than difficult ones. You can also add translations for your own native language!</li>
  <li><strong>Reference to resources that already exist on a topic, and make sure to give credit to those who deserve it. </strong>Are you adapting work from other sources which was published under a creative commons licence? Add the name of the author you based your work on. And, if possible, add a link to the original work as well.</li>
  <li><strong>Your article does not have to be perfect. </strong>Others are here to help you. You can start writing an article, which others can finish.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it accessible for everyone. </strong>Make sure to provide an alternative title for pictures so that people with screen readers know what is shown too.</li>
  <li><strong>Make it look engaging: </strong>Add some illustrations, pictures and videos.</li>
  <li><strong>Stick to our </strong><a href="/about/principles"><strong>principles</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1>Page template&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Every article should contain the following (in this order):</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Title: </strong>The title should be short and clearly describe what the page is about. It should clearly distinguish it from other pages. It cannot be a sentence or question.</li>
  <li><strong>Subtitle: </strong>The subtitle should contain additional keywords that people might search for. But remember that the subtitle is not just for search engine optimisation, it also has to be relevant for website visitors.</li>
  <li><strong>Short introduction in bold (required). </strong>The introduction should outline the contents of the page.explain what the page is about and why it might (not) be relevant for the reader. Should be max 4 lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Short introduction not in bold:</strong> Underneath the first part of the introduction, you should illustrate what the page is about using examples, a short engaging story or something similar. Should be max 6 lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Encourage people to contribute to the page.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Subtopics (bullet list):</strong> If there are any subtopics of the page, make sure to add a list directly underneath the introduction. Subtopics always use the following linking structure "activishandbook.org/main-topic/sub-topic".</li>
  <li><strong>Content of page</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Footnotes: </strong>When you do not want to obstruct the main content with a comment, you can add it in the footnotes.</li>
  <li><strong>Related articles (bullet list): </strong>To make it easier for activists to find the information they are looking for on this site, add a list of related articles at the bottom of each page. These articles can be from a different chapter. They should not be subtopics (as those are already in the 'subtopic' section).</li>
  <li><strong>Related resources (bullet list): </strong>Do not try to reinvent the wheel, it is very likely that someone else has already done some great work. Make it easier for your fellow activists to find relevant resources.</li>
  <li><strong>References (bullet list):</strong> A list of all recourses that are referenced in the text.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Adding resources</h1>
<p>The first step when writing a new article is to collect resources. Resources can be external articles, books, movies, and more. Here are a few tips when collecting resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make clear what kind of resource it is</strong> by adding the type between brackets after the title like so: <i>Title Of Resource <u>[movie/video/book]</u></i></li>
  <li><strong>Make clear what in what language(s) the resource is available</strong> when it is in a different language than the page it is on. Add it between brackets after the title like so: <i>Titel Van Artikel <u>[Deutch/Nederlands]</u></i></li>
  <li><strong>Make sure to archive the resource. </strong>This way, even if the original link breaks (for example, when the link changes or the page is deleted), users will still be able to access the resource. Use <a href="https://web.archive.org">web.archive.org</a> to archive web pages.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Style guide</h1>
<p><strong>We use consistent formatting and styling to make it easier for visitors to skim through our website and find the content they were looking for. The examples below show how to format our website.</strong></p>
<p>To subdivide an article with titles, first use the <strong>Heading 1</strong>. Subsections of particular parts are marked with <strong>Heading 2</strong>, and so forth.</p>
<p>Make links <a href="#style-guide"><strong>bold</strong></a> if they are an important part of the page. For example: do not make links to external resources bold, unless the page's main aim is to help people find external resources.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Think carefully about what kind of list style to use. If there is no particular order in which users are supposed to read the points, use a <strong>bulleted list</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Use a <strong>numbered list</strong> if you would like to indicate a specific order of the items you are discussing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not use different <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">font families</span>.</p>
<p>References look like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#">Name of article</a> [Language, video/book] by Author (2020-12-01) | <a href="#">View in archive</a></li>
</ul>
