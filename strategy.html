<p><strong>In this chapter, we discuss how to choose and build a strategy for your movement based on your purpose and long-term goals.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you‚Äôre looking for information about how to mobilize and start a movement take a look at the <a href="/en/organising"><i>Organizing</i></a> chapter</p>

<h1><strong>Different types of strategies</strong></h1>
<p>There is a wide variety of strategies and choosing a strategy is not an easy task. The vision and goals of your movement will dictate the strategies (and tactics) you want to choose. Example: If your goal is to increase the number of urban gardens, going on strikes or protest marches isn‚Äôt a very useful tactic. The resources spent for mobilizing and securing a protest would be better spent on actual gardening. And if you‚Äôre worried about the safety of your gardens, organizing a neighborhood watch might prove a more useful tactic than starting an advocating campaign for increased surveillance.</p>
<p>There are many ways to differentiate between types of strategies. We decided to use two factors: focus on the system (institutions) or communities (people) and whether strategies are more on the radical (disruptive) or lenient (reformative) side of things. You can find a visual representation of this typology below.</p>

<p>The reason we didn‚Äôt like any of the existing ways to distinguish between strategies is that they heavily focus on political activism and institutional strategies. People building community workshops and giving free classes in sign language are rarely seen or identify themselves as activists.</p>
<p>Learn more about the tactics that you can use for each of these strategies:</p>

  <li><strong>üìö </strong><a href="/en/tactics/cultural"><strong>Change our culture</strong></a>, through education, art and awareness campaigns</li>
  <li><strong>üõ† </strong><a href="/en/tactics/alternative-building"><strong>Build alternatives</strong></a>, through creation of new spaces for communities</li>
  <li><strong>üèõ </strong><a href="/en/tactics/institutional"><strong>Work within institutions</strong></a>, through election campaigns, lobbying, legal action and financial pressure</li>
</ul>
<p>You don‚Äôt necessarily&nbsp; have to stay within just one of the categories, but make sure that the strategies and tactics you chose don‚Äôt clash with each other. If you‚Äôre&nbsp; trying to build relationships with the people in your social environment, being seen as ‚Äúradical‚Äù is not a good move. On the other hand, if you really want to make big and fast changes by building alternatives, you are wasting time if you focus primarily on policy making and lobbying, and expecting the government to introduce these alternatives.</p>
<h1>Writing a strategy together&nbsp;</h1>
<p>We have written several articles to help you write a strategy for your movement. We have added step-by-step guides for organising workshop sessions to start writing a strategy together with fellow rebels.</p>
<h2>Strategy components</h2>
<p>Write your own strategy by putting together the following elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="scope-goals"><strong>Scope and goals</strong></a>: What primary objective to you focus on?</li>
  <li><a href="vision"><strong>Vision</strong></a> What does the situation you are working towards look like?</li>
  <li><a href="situational-analysis"><strong>Situational analysis</strong></a>: What is the context? What are the root causes?</li>
  <li><a href="critical-path-analysis"><strong>Critical path analysis</strong></a>: What changes need to take place along the way?</li>
  <li><a href="stakeholders"><strong>Stakeholders</strong></a>: Who your allies, constituents and targets?</li>
  <li><a href="objectives"><strong>Objectives</strong></a><strong>: </strong>What specific or tangible outcomes do you aim to achieve to further the campaign goals?</li>
  <li><a href="evaluation"><strong>Evaluation</strong></a><strong>: </strong>What will success look like and how will you know when it‚Äôs happening?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Templates &amp; workgroup guides</h2>
<p>There is no ‚Äúone right way‚Äù to capture and communicate all the elements of strategy. &nbsp;Some organisations have a preference for simple one-page tables. Others use longly narrative formats or complex documents that extend to 20 pages or more. &nbsp;Some templates we‚Äôve seen used effectively are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-strategy-chart/"><strong>tCA strategy chart</strong></a>: The anatomy of a campaign strategy: a chart illustrating elements of strategy and processes your group can use to develop them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-campaign-strategy-template/"><strong>tCA campaign strategy template</strong></a>: a template incorporating elements of strategy and suggested processes to develop each element with members of your group</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/basic-strategy-grid/"><strong>Basic strategy grid</strong></a>: An adapted version of the Midwest Academy‚Äôs community organising grid, this simple table provides one way of developing and integrating key pieces of a strategy in a logical sequence.</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-strategy-grid/"><strong>tCA strategy grid</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/strategic-planning-template-2/"><strong>Strategic planning template</strong></a>: This format has been used by medium-sized environment groups in their annual planning cycle. A simple table requiring vision, objectives, resources and performance indicators. The table is also useful for evaluation purposes.</li>

  <p><strong>This is a background section:</strong> At Activist Handbook, we focus on writing a practical guides for activists. Sometimes, theory gets in the way of that.&nbsp;</p>

  <figcaption><strong>Vancouver Town Hall </strong>‚Äì<strong> </strong>From May 17th to the end of June, communities across Canada held over 150 town halls across the country to build a Green New Deal for Canada. A Green New Deal is an ambitious vision for tackling the climate crisis, seeing the full implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Right to Free Prior and Informed Consent and the TRC recommendations implemented, while creating millions of jobs and leaving no one behind in the process. It is a bold plan to retool our economy at the scale that science and justice demand. That means mass government investment to build a 100% renewable energy economy created safer, healthier communities for all of us.his kind of ambitious plan means a transformative policy platform that stretches across sectors and jurisdictions. And that is why we needed all hands on deck to design it.
