<p><strong>Often, it is quite easy to come up with an idea, but much harder to turn it into reality. In this article, you will learn how to start a new project and finish it successfully at Activist Handbook.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>Steps to follow</h1>
<p>We recommend to follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create project working doc using our Google Docs template.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Fill in the table for the project proposal. We recommend you to do this together with others so that you can get more creative inspiration.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Share the proposal with a project facilitator and all people that might be involved in the project. Ask for input, improve the proposal and determine the priority of the project. You may decide the project idea is cool, but does not currently have priority. If it does have priority, continue by working out a detailed timeline.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Add the project proposal to our project page (either in the ‚Äòongoing‚Äô or ‚Äòideas‚Äô section, depending on the project's priority).</li>
  <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Follow your timeline and reflect regularly to see if the timeline needs any updates.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Once the project is finished, organise a reflection meeting. Write these reflection notes in the project working doc, and possibly improve this page.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Some tips &amp; tricks&nbsp;</h1>
<h2>Keeping an overview</h2>
<p>With multiple people working on different aspects of the same project, it is important to have someone (or multiple people) that keep an overview.</p>
<h2><strong>Setting clear to-do's</strong></h2>
<p>Turn <i>‚Äúlet's change the world‚Äù</i> into smaller and more manageable concrete steps. Make sure that it is clear who does what when. Constantly follow up on to-do's to see if things are going as planned, and then adapt accordingly.</p>
<h2><strong>Facilitating conversations</strong></h2>
<p>Having productive conversations that make all participants feel comfortable requires active facilitation, especially in online video calls. Read our guide on <a href="/support/core/facilitate-meetings">how to facilitate meetings</a>.</p>
<h2>Taking care of wellbeing</h2>
<p>Working together on a project is not just about being as productive as possible. Make sure to continuously keep an eye out for people's mental and physical wellbeing.</p>
<h1>Working with application procedure</h1>
<h2>Accepting application</h2>
<p>Here's an example of a phone call to congratulate someone on getting the position:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hey [<mark class="marker-yellow">name]</mark>, I'm [<mark class="marker-yellow">name]</mark> from Activist Handbook calling about [vacancy]. Am I calling you at a convenient time?</p>
  <p><strong>No</strong> üëâ Would you be able to call another time, or shall I send you a message instead?</p>
  <p><strong>Yes</strong> üëâ Awesome! I'll get straight to it: I'm calling you because you applied for [<mark class="marker-yellow">vacancy]</mark>. We read your application and we really liked [<mark class="marker-yellow">something to like about their application].</mark> We've decided to select you for the position of [<mark class="marker-yellow">vacancy]</mark>. Congratulations!</p>
  <p>[pauze for them to respond]</p>
  <p>I'm really looking forward to working together with you, [<mark class="marker-yellow">name]</mark>. So I have a few practical things to discuss with you. We want to see what date you would be available for [<mark class="marker-yellow">meeting, e.g. one-on-one call to get to know each other]</mark>. What timezone are you in currently? What time is it right now for you?</p>
  <p>[pauze for them to respond]</p>
  <p>In the datepicker, you stated to be available on [<mark class="marker-yellow">day &amp; time in their timezone]</mark>. Does that still work for you?</p>
  <p>[pauze for them to respond]</p>
  <p><strong>No</strong> üëâ Alright, let's see if we can find another date.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Yes</strong> üëâ Perfect, then we'll meet on [<mark class="marker-yellow">day &amp; time in their timezone]</mark>. I'm very much looking forward to getting to know you better.</p>
  <p>[pauze for them to respond]</p>
  <p>Alright, I'll send you a recap of our conversation afterwards, with the date &amp; time, as well as a link to the video call. Again, I'm very happy to have you on our team, and I can't wait to start working together! Do you still have any questions?</p>
  <p>[pauze for them to respond]</p>
  <p>Cool, speak to you soon! Have a good day!</p>
