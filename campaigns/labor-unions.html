<p><strong>In this article, you will learn how to organise for workers' rights as activist. We have collected a series of resources to help you build a labor union and </strong><a href="/organising/action"><strong>organise impactful protest actions</strong></a><strong>. Together we can fight for better working conditions and fairer wages.</strong></p>
<p>Labour unions have been playing a vital role in the development of workers' rights for centuries. They provide a means for workers to come together and <a href="/rights">advocate for our rights</a>, and can be a powerful force for change. With your help, we can make sure that all workers are treated fairly and with respect.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of starting a labour union, or are looking for advice on how to strengthen an existing union, then you have come to the right place. In this article, we will outline the basics of organising a union, and provide some resources to help you get started.</p>
