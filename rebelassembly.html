<h1>In short</h1>
<p>No-one is born an activist. And our education system certainly does not tell us how to rebel. So let's write a handbook together.</p>
<p><strong>We are so done with this shitfuckery. It is time to train rebels and uproot the system. </strong>Real people need real practical help in our fight against injustice. No more blah blah blah. At the International Rebel Assembly, we do not write articles just for the sake of writing articles. We want to bring about real change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event is an intense, sprint-like team work activity that lasts for only 2 days, and produces clear written outputs. All your work will be added to Activist Handbook, the Wikipedia for rebels.</p>
<h1>Q&amp;A</h1>
<h2>Who can join this event?</h2>
<p>We invite all green, social and progressive activists who live in the following timezones to join: UTC-1 to UTC+4 (Africa, East &amp; West Europe, Middle East).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who is organising the rebel assembly?</h2>
<p>A prep team consisting of activists from around the globe will be coordinating this decentralised event. We invite all activist movements to participate in the International Rebel Assembly by organising a local hub.</p>
<h2>How do I organise a local hub?</h2>
<p>If you would like to organise a local hub, apply as hub coordinator. We will open up the call for local hub coordinators on the 28th of March. Once we have selected the hub coordinators, we will share more information.</p>
<h2>What will we be doing?</h2>
<p>All over the globe, activists will be coming together in local hubs. In 48 hours, we will be producing practical guides to help change-makers make impact.</p>
