<p><strong>Within this article we will explain the basic contents that (ideally) every article or page on the website is following. These guidelines make sure our chapters are well structured and easy to navigate. We want our readers to familiarize with Activist Handbook easily</strong></p>

<h1>Page template&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Every article should contain the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Title:</strong> should be short and clearly announce what the article or page is about. We strongly advise you not to make it a sentence or a question and to keep it under 30 characters. (Ex:<strong> </strong><i><strong>Article Structure</strong></i>)</li>
  <li><strong>Subtitle: </strong>The subtitle should contain additional keywords that people might search for when looking for the article or page. But remember that the subtitle is not just for search engine optimization, it also has to be relevant for website visitors. (Ex: <i><strong>This is how we structure articles on the website</strong></i>)</li>
  <li><strong>Short overview in bold (required). </strong>The overview should outline the contents of the article or page, explain what it is about and why it might (not) be relevant for the reader. This section also contains disclaimers about the state of the article (<strong>complete, under construction, flagged for review</strong> etc.) Recommended length for the introduction is one paragraph.</li>
  <li><strong>Short introduction:</strong> Underneath the overview, you should illustrate what the article or page is about using examples, a short engaging story or an illustration<sup>1</sup>.</li>
  <li><strong>Subtopics (bullet list):</strong> If the topic is too complex to fit in one page, make sure to break the article into multiple pages and link the related pages directly underneath the introduction. Subtopics always use the following linking structure "activishandbook.org/main-topic/sub-topic".</li>
  <li><strong>Content of the page</strong>: This is the main content of your article or page.</li>
  <li><strong>How to contribute: </strong>Encourage people to contribute to the page. Try to insert creative calls to actions when appropriate. Are we looking for more resources? Are we looking for a specific perspective on the topic? How could people want to engage with the article you are writing?</li>
  <li><strong>Footnotes: </strong>When you do not want to obstruct the main content with a comment, you can add it in the footnotes.<sup>2</sup></li>
  <li><strong>Related articles (bullet list): </strong>To make it easier for activists to find the information they are looking for on this site, add a list of related articles at the bottom of each page. These articles can be from a different chapter.</li>
  <li><strong>Related resources (bullet list): </strong>This is a section where you can list all the external resources that are relevant to the topic but not covered in the article you are writing.</li>
  <li><strong>References (bullet list):</strong> A list of all resources that are referenced in the text of the article or page you are writing.<sup>3</sup></li>
</ol>
