<ul>
  <li>⭕️ Core circle</li>
  <li>💬 Communication circle</li>
  <li>✍️ Content circle</li>

  <p>⚠️ We are very sorry that the logbook links for our circles are currently unavailable but, we are working on it! Until the pages are once again functional, you can find the video recordings of our meetings on our <a href="https://activisthandbook.slack.com/archives/CT8DLJ1FW">#general</a> channel in our <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/activisthandbook/shared_invite/zt-e1d26qma-nUiopZFKEiXf3lUwll_jhw">Slack workspace</a>.</p>

<h1>Why do we keep a logbook?</h1>
<p>All Activist Handbook circles keep a logbook. We do this because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>We work more effectively by remembering our previous actions.</li>
  <li>We want to be transparent about our decision making process.</li>
  <li>We want to make it easier for new members to join.</li>
  <li>We want to help fellow activists understand how to manage an organisation.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What do we record?</h1>
<p>The following will be recorded by teams in our logbook:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Someone starts or stops as coordinator</li>
  <li>Meetings, with minutes and recordings attached</li>
  <li>Important decisions and actions</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
