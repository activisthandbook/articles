<p><strong>What you need to know about your political environment, your own goals, and the people you communicate with: these are the topics that will be covered in this article.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Understand your goals</strong><br><strong>a case study</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Who needs to do what?</strong><br>Before jumping straight to the practicalities of setting up your social media accounts and creating posts, it is important to have a strategic vision that keeps your goals at the center and allows you to focus resources more efficiently. Even if it may seem obvious, it helps to write down the basics – desired outcome, parties involved in achieving the outcome, xyz – to put structure to your thoughts and ensure consistency over time. (After writing down the basics, you can always take a look at the document months later.)</p>
<p>Let’s take the example of an activist group that wants the parliament to pass a same-sex marriage law. Some basic questions to help you get started could be as follows.</p>
<p><strong>What is the desired outcome of your activism?</strong>&nbsp;<br>For the parliament to pass the law and ensure equality for LGBTQIA+ families.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think needs to happen for the parliament to pass the law?</strong><br>Society must be more supportive of the law and elect pro-LGBTQIA+ or convince “moderate” politicians, who can then ensure a majority vote to pass the legislation.</p>
<p><strong>How do we measure this happening?</strong><br>Most countries with free press will have opinion polling that shows the society’s attitudes on various issues. Political parties will likely have clear stances on the issue in their program or rhetoric, or we can examine their voting records.</p>
<p>From these simple answers we already get two ideas for communications – we have to speak to politicians who make the decision and we have to speak to the voters that give them a mandate, so politicians have to follow their wishes to get re-elected. We also have clear ways of measuring whether we and our allies are getting closer to our goals.</p>
<h2><strong>Target Groups</strong></h2>
<p>As activists, we are unlikely to have enough resources to consistently engage an entire country’s population, therefore we can start narrowing it down to certain target groups that we can realistically engage. It is important to be realistic as our job is not only to speak up for the sake principles, but to see practical change.</p>
<p>Activist communications is all about convincing others to support and, hopefully, join your cause. It is about raising awareness to injustices and empowering people to do something about it, whether by providing information and resources or simply inspiration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we often deal with limited resources, it is useful to “preach to the choir” to mobilize existing supporters to spread our messages on their own. That way we can decentralize our communications with potential “agents of change” that can talk to people within their social circles – family and relatives, friends, classmates and colleagues – to do their part in shifting societal attitudes, instead of hoping that our social media posts will be enough to reach and convince everyone.</p>
<p>In our example of LGBTQIA+ activism, we can make an educated assumption that younger people are most likely to be supportive of the cause in most countries. [citation needed]&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>What to consider?</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Platform demographics</strong></h2>
<p>[Add data sources]</p>
<p>Not everyone can be reached (effectively) through every platform. Each social media and other platform (TV or digital news, e-mail etcetera) has their own demographics and different algorithmic specifics that support or impede our progress in achieving certain goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if you want to mobilize young people for LGBTQIA+ causes, it is likely that your resources will be used more effectively on Instagram and TikTok. These are platforms with younger audiences and algorithms conductive to viral spread of LGBTQIA+ messages. Whereas on LinkedIn you may be less effective as its users expect different types of content and might not engage as much with activist content. That does not mean that you would not see success or reach your target groups on LinkedIn, <s>but it does mean that you might not get the same “bang for your buck” (for example, invested workhours versus people reached) as elsewhere</s>.</p>
