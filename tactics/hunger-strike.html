<p>A hunger strike is a powerful way to put pressure on your opponents and make them take your demands seriously. It can also be a very risky move, both physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>Essentially, a hunger strike means you refuse food until you are at death's door, and then the authorities have to choose between letting you die, and letting you go. Obviously, this is a very extreme measure that should only be used as a last resort.</p>
<p>Hunger strikes have been used by everyone from Gandhi to the suffragettes to the civil rights movement. They can be an incredibly effective way to get your message across and make your opponents take notice. However, they're also very risky both physically and emotionally, so you should only consider using them if you're prepared for the consequences.</p>
