<p><strong>People all over the world protest for affordable housing. On Activist Handbook, you can find resources on how to organise yourself effectively.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± Dutch housing protests: </strong>There is a huge shortage in affordable housing in the Netherlands. In 2021, over 8000 people in Rotterdam protested for <a href="https://woonopstand.nl/en/">affordable housing</a>. The protest was covered widely across news media, because of the disproportionate police violence used. After the protests, several municipalities announced they would start requiring people to live in the houses they buy, to counter slumlords (â€˜zelfwoonplichtâ€™).</li>
  <li><strong>ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª German housing protests: </strong>In Berlin, 10.000 people went to the streets to demand an end to the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/berlin-protesters-urge-end-to-soaring-rents/a-57635183">soaring rent prices</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Guides for housing activists</h1>
<p>We have written a chapter on <a href="/organising">how to build a movement</a>, which you can use to learn how to organise yourself effectively to fight for tenant rights together. Before getting right into it by organising a housing protest, we recommend you to think about your <a href="/strategy">long term strategy</a>. Make sure to prepare yourself for a long run, because it can take a while before politicians finally start to hear you. This is why it is also important that you <a href="/wellbeing">do not burn out your volunteers</a>.</p>
<p>Most people immediately think of a protest march, when wanting to bring attention to a cause. However, you can also get creative and check out our <a href="/tactics">tactics</a> chapter. You will need to <a href="/communication">promote your action</a> beforehand. If you do not have a large audience on your movement's <a href="/tools/social-media/">social media</a> yet, you use the network of your active volunteers. And remember: your fight against exorbitant rent prices likely does not end after one action. You can use actions to recruit new people, so that you can mobilise more for the next one.</p>
<p>The municipality may sympathise more with landlords, and try to intimidate you with a large police presence. It is good to know, however, that you have certain <a href="/rights">legal rights</a> as an activist. Even if you get arrested, there are certain things that the police may and may not do to you. We also recommend to find a lawyer with experience defending activists to support your movement.</p>
