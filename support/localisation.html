<h1>About this circle</h1>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Localisation circle is working on ways to adapt the contents of Activist Handbook to the local contexts of our readers, by translating the articles into various languages and looking for examples of activist practices in local communities. We are also aiming to strengthen local activist communities through the “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLC8OHYbzKo4v4UDkao27Z2NQIy5OBSc_SXs0uLqMBk/edit">Local circles</a>” project.</p>
<p>We value diversity and inclusivity, we're constantly searching for ways to bridge cultural and language gaps, we organise.</p>

<h1><s>Localisation Circle Purpose</s></h1>
<blockquote>
  <p><s>Localise our content and community</s></p>
</blockquote>
<p><s>We want to make sure Activist Handbook is useful everywhere, not just in the Global North. This is a challenging task that requires us to find members from various countries and adapt our articles and content to their context as well as finding what's universal about various tactics regardless of where they are being used&nbsp;</s><i> <mark class="marker-yellow">[this section is a duplication of Airtable, should be moved there]</mark></i></p>
<h1><s>Localisation Circle Domain</s></h1>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><s>Translation</s></li>
    <li><s>Creation of Local Circles</s></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p><s>Groups of translators, Slack channels about translation, local groups… these are all in our domain. We're making sure people who speak the same language or come from the same geopolitical areas can find each other and work together to gather and deliver content about activism that's relevant within their context.&nbsp;</s><i> <mark class="marker-yellow">[this section is a duplication of Airtable, should be moved there]</mark></i></p>
