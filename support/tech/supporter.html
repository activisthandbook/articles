  <li><strong>Website: </strong>Sign in to the website using their Google Workspace account. Make sure to explain how they can edit their own volunteer guide.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Administrative steps</h2>
<p>When new volunteers join our organisation, you are responsible for doing the following.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/users"><strong>Create a new user account</strong></a> for this volunteer in the Google Admin Console. Use only their first name for their email address, unless it is already taken.</li>
  <li>In the Google Admin Console, update the <strong>contact information</strong> (under the user information section) and <strong>recovery information</strong> (under the security section) of the <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/users/">user profile</a>. As contact info, add both their email and phone number. As recovery info, only add their email. You can find their info in the <a href="https://airtable.com/appVJ580r68oWQ6M4/tblOYDNnw2Jv949h5/viwkZvqrSbpuyXrpp?blocks=hide">volunteer list in Airtable</a>.</li>
  <li>Add the user to the right <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/groups"><strong>user groups</strong></a> in the Google Admin Console. This way, they will automatically get access to the right passwords.</li>
  <li>Give new accounts access to our collaborative <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/calendar/Y29udGFjdEBhY3RpdmlzdGhhbmRib29rLm9yZw"><strong>Google Calendar</strong></a>, so they can see and edit our events.</li>
  <li><a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/addcalendar"><strong>Subscribe</strong></a> to the calendar of the new user account, so we can see all individual meetings in the contact@activisthandbook.org account.</li>
  <li>Add the new account to the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AOSIwq58KDWkUk9PVA"><strong>shared Google Drive</strong>.</a></li>
  <li>Add the email address of the new user to <a href="https://account.grammarly.com/admin/members"><strong>Grammarly</strong></a>, so they have access to our Pro team subscription.</li>
  <li>Add them to the right Slack channels.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Keep tech guide up-to-date</h2>
<p>As a tech supporter, it is your responsibility to keep our <a href="/support/tools">tech guide for volunteers</a> up to date.</p>
<h1>Common issues</h1>
<h2>Forgot Google Workspace password</h2>
<p>Reset their password in the <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/users/">Google Admin Console</a>. Choose an automatically generated one, and click the send email button. They will then receive a link to reset it. This link is only valid for a limited time.</p>
<p>They can also reset it themselves with their personal email address if you added it to their recovery info.</p>
<h2>Forgot website password</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ask what email address they used to log in</li>
  <li>Look up their name &amp; email address in the admin view of our website. If there is none, look them up in our Slack &amp; Mailchimp, to see if they may have used another email address. If you then still cannot find the account, they probably just never created one. In that case, show them how to create an account.</li>
  <li>If you can find the account in the website admin dashboard, change the password for them (use a random password generator). Send them this password, and ask them to change it. Once they are signed in, this can be done here: <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/p/profile">https://www.activisthandbook.org/p/profile</a></li>
