<p><strong>This article is about a set of practices used by activists to avoid or mitigate the effects of police surveillance and harassment and state control. We warn about the risks of security culture, and discuss the importance of taking an open approach. We also wrote a guide specifically about </strong><a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/tools/security"><strong>digital security</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>A security culture is a set of customs and measures shared by a community whose members may engage in sensitive or illegal activities. Security culture practices minimize the risks of members getting arrested or their actions being foiled.</p>
<p>In other words, while we are trying to stop bad things from happening, our powerful opponents (usually governments or corporations) are working hard to stop us. This guide is about the security measures activists can take to protect ourselves and make our work more effective.</p>
<h1>Threats</h1>
<p>This guide mostly focuses on the actions of law enforcement, such as intelligence officers and police, as it usually has the greatest authority to target activists.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Law enforcement uses the legal system to harass protesters</strong></h3>
<p>There are many ways that law enforcement use its powers to stop activists. They excessively investigate, charge and convict activists on trumped-up charges, arrest organizers prior to large protests, and conduct mass arrests of law- abiding citizens during protests. All these strategies were deployed during the G8/G20 protests in Toronto in 2010, for example.</p>
<p>Governments also unfairly apply tax laws to pressure groups to release information, and use grand juries (in the States) to intimidate and silence people and their allies. (Corporations also use civil courts to harass activists, often suing individuals for compensation for lost profits.)</p>
<p>Battling with the courts and spending time in jail is an exceptionally effective way to compound stress and burn- out, and redirect a group’s efforts to raising legal fees and tackling the legal system. This strategy is commonly used by law enforcement and should be of greatest concern to activist groups.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Law enforcement investigates and infiltrates groups</strong></h3>
<p>In the pursuit of investigating potential and alleged crimes, police engage in excessive and sometimes illegal physical and electronic surveillance, such as: searching cars and homes, following (“tailing”) people, monitoring email and phone communications, and identifying people simply for being activists or attending activist events.</p>
<p>Like The Wire TV series, law enforcement uses informants who are civilians who gather information for the police, usually for money. Anyone can be an informant: your landlord, disgruntled activists, or random students. Police have a tendency to target people with exploitable weaknesses, such as people facing prison time, or suffering drug/gambling/money problems. It’s common for police to offer arrested activists a sweeter plea bargain in return for incriminating information on other activists. Unfor- tunately, the pursuit of suspected spies can scare off new activists and set off waves of paranoia.</p>
<p>On rarer occasions, law enforcement gathers information through undercover agents who pose as activists. For an extreme example, take police officer, Mark Kennedy, who went deep undercover as a British environmental direct action activist, going to protests around Europe for over seven years.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Law enforcement disrupts activities</strong></h3>
<p>Infiltrators can disrupt or stymie meetings, and spread malicious gossip and rumors (like accusing others of being undercover agents). This is not law enforcement’s primary tactic. These operations are usually organized on a fed- eral level and are longer term. For a recent example, read <a href="http://www.theragblog.com/lisa-fithian-fbi-informant-brandon-darby-sexism-egos-and-lies/">activist Lisa Fithian’s report</a> on the disruptive behavior of a long-time informant named Brandon Darby working on the New Orleans reconstruction effort.</p>
<p>Law enforcement also encourages activists to engage in property destruction and violence; these tactics can be used to justify a strong police crackdown and the labeling of ac- tivists as “terrorists.” Check out <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/quebec-police-admit-they-went-undercover-at-montebello-protest-1.656171">this footage</a> of a 2008 protest in Montebello, Quebec, which shows masked-men (one of whom is holding a rock) trying to instigate violence near a police line. After public outcry, the Quebec police admitted the “violent activists” were undercover police. However, this is not the most common strategy for law enforcement to deploy.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Opponents and law enforcement engage in targeted excessive force and violence</strong></h3>
<p>On occasion, law enforcement harms activists at protests or in jail. In a few cases, law enforcement has also been implicated in assassinations of usually high profile radi- cal activists, such as black civil rights leaders in the 60s and 70s. These strategies are not as common as other law enforcement measures.</p>
<h1>Cure worse than disease?</h1>
<p>Measure you take to avoid being surveiled and infiltrated might do more harm than good to your movement. Often, these measures mean you are making your movement more secretive and less accessible for new people to join. And this might actually be exactly what your oppressors want you to do: hiding in a shell instead of challanging the status quo out in the open.</p>
<p>To give an example:&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Imagine you find out that the government is forcing Telegram to share the contents of users' group chat messages. You could decide to switch to Signal, which is better for security because it uses end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>But what if no-one in your country uses Signal? You might be able to convice the most dedicated members to switch, but you will probably find that fewer new people join your Signal group chat and become involved in your movement.</i></p>
<h1>Benefits of open approach</h1>
<p>An open approach in activism is often more effective.</p>
<p>There is power in numbers: even if you are planning an illegal action completely in the open, police might not be able to stop all of you. Especially when you organise <i><strong>decentralised</strong></i> on a large scale, in many cases, it is impossible to law enforcent to track down and stop every single small action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, law enforcement will know who you are. Yes, they will know what you are planning on organising. But so will everyone else. If you want to achieve big change, eventually, you want everyone to know about you and your message, and the only way to do so is by taking action out in the open.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This is scary, and in many cases dangerous. </strong>If you are using civil disobedience as a tactic, likeley, people within your movement will be prosecuted. Depending on where you live, the consequences may be worse. The question is: is it worth it? There is no one-fits-all answer for all movements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important: The word ‘decentralised’ is key! </strong>If you are a very large movement, but you have pyramid-like (top-down) organisation structure, law enforcement can very easily bring down your whole movement by arresting your leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Threat model</h1>
<h2><strong>Assess your risk</strong></h2>
<p>This guide first outlines some general guidelines, and then offers some specific advice you can take to minimize these threats.</p>
<p>There’s no easy answer to the tough question, How securi- ty conscious should I be? The consequences of surveillance and harassment have the potential to be severe; however, being overly cautious and constantly preparing for the worst can be debilitating.</p>
<p>Ask yourself, are you at high, low, or medium interest to law enforcement? The table below is a useful guide to help you assess where your group is at.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/organising/security-culture/risk-assesment.png"></figure>
<p>If your group has a combination of higher interest factors then you are more likely to be subject to surveillance and harassment.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure you’re experiencing surveillance and harassment, and you want an indication of what to expect or prepare for, then look at how law enforcement is dealing with groups similar to yours. (Having said that, past police practice doesn’t always predict how police will act in the future.)</p>
<p>It is also useful to gather public information to help you assess how much energy law enforcement could be direct- ing towards your group or issue. Law enforcement often makes public announcements about the size and scope of their security budgets and priorities. In the early 2000s, the FBI was very vocal about its decision to classify extremist animal rights and environmental activists as “terrorists” and quash their activities. Security budgets are usually boosted just prior to high profile national or international meetings, like a G8/G20 Summit or a Republican National Convention, for instance.</p>
<p>Also remember that individuals in your group are subject to different levels of risk. People of color and marginalized people (such as non-citizens) are often of greater interest to law enforcement; some folks are often more vulnerable to the consequences of arrest. (For example, mothers who are arrested and charged with serious crimes are often threat- ened with losing custody of their children if they don’t become informants for the police.)</p>
<p>Think through how your group will protect and support your most vulnerable members. For instance, you might choose to avoid putting high-risk people in arrestable posi- tions at protests. Or you might assign more experienced lawyers to represent more vulnerable people in court. There are no one-size-fits all solutions to this dilemma.</p>
<h2>Local contexts matter</h2>
<p>To be able to decide whether it is worth accepting the risks of an open approach, local context matters. There may be very good reasons to keep your movement secretive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are two examples where it might be better to build small resistance communities with only people you fully trust:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>If your government straight away imprisons anyone who speaks up.</i></li>
  <li><i>If it is a common police practice to infiltrate movements not just for the purpose of collecting intelligence, but also to destabilise your movement. For example, they do this by starting violence during a peaceful protest, to make you look bad or create an excuse to arrest you.</i></li>
</ul>
<h2>Weigh the “pros” and “cons”</h2>
<p>Consider whether each security measure is worth imple- menting, and, if so, make an effort to mitigate the “cons.” It is not beneficial to implement security measures to the point where you are spending more energy being “secure” than you are in pursuing your activist goals.</p>
<p>Many security measures are straightforward. It’s easy to protect your computer with a complicated passphrase, for instance. Other precautions have negative consequences, taxing a group’s time, resources, overall health, and the recruitment of new members.</p>
<p>Some technical fixes (such as encrypting all emails) usually require some expertise in information technology, training and retraining of members, and monitoring, because people forget, get lax, etc. It might be worth adopting these measures if your small group relies heavily on online com- munication and is conducting a hard-to-execute action that requires surprise (hanging banners off large buildings, for instance). However, some of these solutions don’t scale up well. For instance, it is more difficult to implement email encryption if you’re working with hundreds of people.</p>
<h1>How to contribute</h1>
<p>You have stumbled upon quite an empty page. Contribute by working on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discuss the risks of closing off your movement from the outside world (while the inclination to become more secretive to defend yourself against infiltration and surveilance is understandable, you should question whether this is not extactly doing what our oppressors want: hiding in a shell instead of challanging the status quo out in the open).</li>
  <li>Discuss the open &amp; transparent approach we take at Activist Handbook</li>
  <li>Discuss local contexts (e.g. strong history of security culture in the US)</li>
  <li>Discuss steps to take against infiltration &amp; surveilance, take <a href="http://nonviolence.rutgers.edu/document/IIP0310F07">this publication</a> as a starting point (published under Creative Commons licence). The section on protecting data should be added to <a href="/tools/security">another page</a> of our website (also, it should be updated, not to included outdated software).</li>
