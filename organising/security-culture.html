<p><strong>This article is about a set of practices used by activists to avoid or mitigate the effects of police surveillance and harassment and state control. We warn about the risks of security culture, and discuss the importance of taking an open approach. We also wrote a guide specifically about </strong><a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/tools/security"><strong>digital security</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<h1>Cure worse than disease?</h1>
<p>Measure you take to avoid being surveiled and infiltrated might do more harm than good to your movement. Often, these measures mean you are making your movement more secretive and less accessible for new people to join. And this might actually be exactly what your oppressors want you to do: hiding in a shell instead of challanging the status quo out in the open.</p>
<p>To give an example:&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Imagine you find out that the government is forcing Telegram to share the contents of users' group chat messages. You could decide to switch to Signal, which is better for security because it uses end-to-end encryption.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>But what if no-one in your country uses Signal? You might be able to convice the most dedicated members to switch, but you will probably find that fewer new people join your Signal group chat and become involved in your movement.</i></p>
<h1>Benefits of open approach</h1>
<p>At Activist Handbook, we believe an open approach in activism is often more effective.</p>
<p>There is power in numbers: even if you are planning an illegal action completely in the open, police might not be able to stop all of you. Especially when you organise <i><strong>decentralised</strong></i> on a large scale, in many cases, it is impossible to law enforcent to track down and stop every single small action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, law enforcement will know who you are. Yes, they will know what you are planning on organising. But so will everyone else. If you want to achieve big change, eventually, you want everyone to know about you and your message, and the only way to do so is by taking action out in the open.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This is scary, and in many cases dangerous. </strong>If you are using civil disobedience as a tactic, likeley, people within your movement will be prosecuted. Depending on where you live, the consequences may be worse. The question is: is it worth it? There is no one-fits-all answer for all movements.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important: The word ‘decentralised’ is key! </strong>If you are a very large movement, but you have pyramid-like (top-down) organisation structure, law enforcement can very easily bring down your whole movement by arresting your leaders.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Local contexts matter</h1>
<p>To be able to decide whether it is worth accepting the risks of an open approach, local context matters. There may be very good reasons to keep your movement secretive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are two examples where it might be better to build small resistance communities with only people you fully trust:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>If your government straight away imprisons anyone who speaks up.</i></li>
  <li><i>If it is a common police practice to infiltrate movements not just for the purpose of collecting intelligence, but also to destabilise your movement. For example, they do this by starting violence during a peaceful protest, to make you look bad or create an excuse to arrest you.</i></li>
</ul>
<h1>How to contribute</h1>
<p>You have stumbled upon quite an empty page. Contribute by working on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discuss the risks of closing off your movement from the outside world (while the inclination to become more secretive to defend yourself against infiltration and surveilance is understandable, you should question whether this is not extactly doing what our oppressors want: hiding in a shell instead of challanging the status quo out in the open).</li>
  <li>Discuss the open &amp; transparent approach we take at Activist Handbook</li>
  <li>Discuss local contexts (e.g. strong history of security culture in the US)</li>
  <li>Discuss steps to take against infiltration &amp; surveilance (while warning not to get paranoid)</li>
</ul>
