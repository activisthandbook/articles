<h1>We meet online</h1>
<p>We're activists from all over the world, so we cannot regularly meet face to face. Instead, we regularly have video calls. Are you new with Activist Handbook? We would very much like to get to know you during our next call! We also have an open <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/activisthandbook/">Facebook group</a> in which activists can exchange experiences. Lastly, we communicate using a Slack workplace. If you would like to join our Slack, make sure to fill in the form above</p>
<p>Our community exists out of over 100 people from 20+ different countries (check out our <a href="/en/map">members map</a>). More than 450 people have joined our Facebook group. Learn more about our team on the <a href="/about">about page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
