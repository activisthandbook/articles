<p><strong>In this SEO guide for nonprofits, we teach you how to do keyword research. Social change-makers do not have a lot of money, so we compare the best free and affordable tools to find keywords. Even if you have no experience with search engine optimisation yet, this guide should help you get started.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In this guide we talk about keywords. Also make sure to check out our more general guide about <a href="/tools/seo">search engine optimisation for nonprofits</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>The basics</h1>
<p>If you want people to find your website, you should write about things that people are looking up. And if you want to show up high in the search rankings, write about topics that other websites have not yet produced high-quality content for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some features to look out for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Suggestions for new keywords:</strong> helps you brainstorm and find keywords that people look up most (based on your input: a keyword, your website or competitors' websites)</li>
  <li><strong>Search query popularity: </strong>the frequency with which people look up certain keywords (globally or in a certain location/language)</li>
  <li><strong>Difficulty to rank for keywords: </strong>how likely it is that you will show up high in the search results, based on competing webpages for that keyword</li>
</ul>
<h1>Our recommendations</h1>
<p>Since all the keyword tools listed on this page are free or freemium, we recommend you to use a combination to make sure of the best features from each.</p>
<p>For example, use the following <strong>recommended</strong> <strong>workflow</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Explore keywords:</strong> Use Answer the Public to get a general overview of all possible search queries related to one topic. Then use AlsoAsked to find and organise subtopics in a structured way. If there is an active Reddit community for your topic, also use Keyworddit.</li>
  <li><strong>Get detailed keyword info:</strong> Use Semrush and Ahrefs to get detailed information about the search volume and ranking difficulty of one particular search query. Data is based on estimates, so less accurate.</li>
  <li><strong>Get accurate comparative data: </strong>Use Google Trends to compare the popularity of several keywords over time and in different geographical areas. Info is based on data collected by Google, so of high accuracy.</li>
</ol>
<p>To learn more about each of these tools and how to use them, read the section below!</p>
<h1>SEO Keyword tools</h1>
<h2>Google Trends</h2>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> has limited functionality but has the highest reporting accuracy (based on actual Google data). It is useful when you want to compare several keywords, want to see how their popularity changes over time, or if you want to find similar keywords.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> 100% free</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed:</strong> no</li>
  <li><strong>Features:</strong> It shows keyword popularity on a scale of 0 to 100 instead of the actual number of searches (which makes this tool much less useful), a timeline of search volume, a map with search volume, and related queries.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>AlsoAsked</strong></h2>
<p>AlsoAsked is useful for finding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> (full questions, instead of just a few words). &nbsp;It bases its data on Google's “People Also Ask” data that appear in Google search results, and organises them in a logical way.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> Freemium. You get 3 free searches per month (definitely do not open an incognito window).</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed:</strong> no</li>
  <li><strong>Features:</strong> find out what questions people have about a certain topic</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Answer the Public</strong></h2>
<p>Answer the Public looks similar to AlsoAsked. However, it differs in that it uses the Google suggested search queries instead of the “People Also Ask” box. Their differences are explained in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4IbchVW7Y">video</a> made by AlsoAsked.</p>
<p>We recommend you to use Answer the Public to get a basic overview of all searches related to a certain topic, and then AlsoAsked to do more detailed research.&nbsp;</p>

  <li><strong>Account needed:</strong> no</li>

<h2><strong>Ahrefs</strong></h2>
<p>Ahrefs offers two free tools for keyword research: <a href="https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator">Keyword Generator </a>and <a href="https://ahrefs.com/keyword-difficulty">Keyword Difficulty Checker</a>. You will have to pass an annoying <i>I’m not a robot</i> test for every keyword you look up, but you can look up unlimited keywords. Data is also limited to the first few keyword results, unless you buy the (very expensive) subscription.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price: </strong>Freemium.</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed: </strong>no</li>
  <li><strong>Features:&nbsp;</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the keyword generator you will get a list of suggested keywords based on your keyword input. For the first few, you can see their volume and difficulty.</li>
      <li>Using the Keyword difficulty checker, you get more detailed info about how difficult it is to get your page to rank high for a certain keyword (showing the required amount of backlinks). You can also see what the search results look like (for the selected country).</li>
      <li>For both, it is not possible to look up the global volume of a keyword.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
