<p><strong>Seeds for Change is a UK-based training organisation for activists that started in 2000. On their website, they provide a valuable collection of resources for change-makers.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/resources">Seeds for Change</a> website, if you would like to learn more about effective campaigning, decision making and facilitation.&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Anti-copyright guides</h1>
<p>The people at Seeds for Change were kind enough to publish all their resources without copyright. At Activist Handbook, we think this is a great practice, because it means we can redistribute and build upon their work.</p>
