<p><strong>In this chapter, we explain what a strategy is, we show various examples of different types of activist strategies, and we provide you with workshops to help you write your own strategy.</strong></p>
<p>With a good strategy your movement or campaign makes more impact. In the articles below, we help you define what exactly the change is that you want to achieve, and what steps you need to take to get there.</p>

  <figcaption><strong>Vancouver Town Hall </strong>‚Äì<strong> </strong>From May 17th to the end of June, communities across Canada held over 150 town halls across the country to build a Green New Deal for Canada. A Green New Deal is an ambitious vision for tackling the climate crisis, seeing the full implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Right to Free Prior and Informed Consent and the TRC recommendations implemented, while creating millions of jobs and leaving no one behind in the process. It is a bold plan to retool our economy at the scale that science and justice demand. That means mass government investment to build a 100% renewable energy economy created safer, healthier communities for all of us.his kind of ambitious plan means a transformative policy platform that stretches across sectors and jurisdictions. And that is why we needed all hands on deck to design it.
