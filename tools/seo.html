<p><strong>In this guide for nonprofits, we help you optimise the search engine performance of your movement's website. To make it easier for your supporters to find you on Google, we also provided some tools for activists to analyse your website and search analytics.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Why is SEO important?</strong></h1>
<p>People use search engines like Google as a primary source of information. If you want people to find out about your digital campaigns, optimising your website to end up higher in the search rankings can really help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online activism is not a replacement of real-life activism, as it is very much reliant on big tech. However, we believe that we can use their own capitalist tools against them. In this article we explain how to end up high in the search results – not to make profit, but to change this world for the better.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <i>At Activist Handbook, we write guides for change-makers. However, there is no point in writing an article about how to organise a protest, if no-one can find it. In addition, we use search analytics to determine what topics activists are interested in.</i></p>
<h1><strong>Ranking criteria</strong></h1>
<p>The following things are taken into account by search engines like Google to determine if your webpage should show up high in the search results:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>High quality content</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Relevant topics &amp; intent</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Quality website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Below we explain what each of these mean in detail.</p>
<h2><strong>High quality content</strong></h2>
<p>Google tries its best to serve people the best content. How do they know? We do not really know, their algorithm is mostly a secret. Make sure to read their own <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide">Google SEO guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short: <strong>Google does not really want to you optimise your website for Google</strong>, because that fucks up their algorithm. Instead, they want you to optimise your content for the reader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you to do exactly that: if you do not really know how to do SEO well, your best guess is just to create content that people like. Chances are that Google will like it too. These are some things that Google looks at:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do people like your content?</strong> For example, they try to determine this by how many people are sharing links to your site. This can be other people adding a link to your website from their own site (backlinks), or people sharing your content on social media.</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content well-written? </strong>Grammar &amp; spelling mistakes</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content well organised?</strong> Headings, links,</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content unique?</strong> Brings new value to readers</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content complete? </strong>Avoid very short articles</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Relevant topics &amp; intent</strong></h2>
<p>You should <strong>write about things that people are interested in</strong>. If you want people to find your article via search engines, there is no point in writing a super high quality article about a topic that nobody looks up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>avoid too general topics</strong>. There will likely already be many articles, and it will be harder to show up high in the search results.</p>
<p>The perfect topic is frequently looked up, but no high quality articles exist about it yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google tries to figure out the <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-intent/"><strong>intent</strong></a> of the person typing in the search query. In other words: what result are they looking for? Those websites will show up higher in the search results.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>For example, someone from Berlin looking up ‘protest today’, probably would like to read news articles about a certain protest that is happening that day in Berlin. Thus, Google will favour webpages from German news websites that have been written on that day. On the other hand, someone looking up ‘how to organise protest’ probably wants a practical guide, which is what Google will show in the results.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Quality of website</strong></h2>
<p>Google also takes into account website <u>loading time</u>, <u>accessiblity</u>, and whether it is optimised for <u>mobile phones</u>. These factors directly impact your search rank. As a writer, these things may be difficult to work on, so this part is mostly useful for developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good start is to analyse the quality of your website using a <a href="https://web.dev/measure/">page analysis tool</a>. This tool scans your website, and also shows real world data collected by Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Some other factors to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crawl</strong>: To be included in the search results, search engines must first be able to find and crawl your website.</li>
  <li><strong>User experience</strong>: Avoid spammy popups and annoying ads.</li>
  <li><strong>Title, URL and description</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Snippets &amp; structured data</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1>Tools for search analytics</h1>
<p>Here is a list of tools that nonprofits and activist organisations can use for their search engine optimisation (SEO):</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/">Search Console Insights</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://ahrefs.com">Ahrefs</a> (has a limited but useful free plan available, paid plans are very expensive)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.semrush.com">Semrush</a> (has limited free plan available, paid plans are very expensive)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Improve this page</h1>
<p>This page about SEO is written by activists like you, and you can help make it better. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using SEO as activist tactic: bringing your message to the public through search engines (perhaps to compete with politicians or companies that you are targeting?)</li>
  <li>Linking to a guide about privacy considerations when using tools like Google Analytics</li>
  <li>Perhaps creating separate guides about each of the tools (e.g. semrush for nonprofits)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are people looking up?</h2>
<p>Originally, the title of this page was ‘search engine optimisation for activists'. However, almost nobody looks up that search query.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a difficult query to compete for: most people writing articles about this topic are very skilled in search engine optimisation, so it is hard to get this article high in the results. There are also many ads for SEO services and tools.</p>
