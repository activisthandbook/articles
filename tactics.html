<p>This page contains a list of various tactics that activists use to make change happen. Note that you do not have to choose one particular tactic. The most successful movements use a combination of tactics and allow people to contribute to the cause in their own way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the tactics below require you to assemble large numbers of people. Make sure to check out our chapter on <a href="/getting-organised">getting organised</a> to find out more about this topic.&nbsp;</p>
