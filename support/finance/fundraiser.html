<h1>The idea of funding</h1>
<p>Traditionally this means looking for financing opportunities. In most cases fundraisers look for calls for proposals, help write budgets for projects, organize crowdfunding campaigns, ask for donations etc.</p>
<p>In Activist Handbook “funding” goes beyond just looking for money. There are multitude of ways of getting second hand equipment which has monetary value, accepting people's work as a form of unpaid gift with a monetary value, finding opensource and free-access spaces, software etc that would have monetary value if they were on a market.&nbsp;</p>
