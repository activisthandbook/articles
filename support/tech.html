<p>Tech circle is in charge of smooth functioning of our website, choices of apps we use in our day-to-day communication, technical support for our users and development of the project <a href="https://rebel.tools/">Rebel Tools</a>.</p>
<p>We use open source code and our long term goal is to assemble a group of dedicated hacker-activists who will work on development of free and secure online apps for activists all over the world.</p>
<p>We're constantly improving Activist Handbook's functionalities and working hard on training our members in web development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Activist Handbook, we're using <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/support/organisation">Holacracy</a>, a way of organising we're not normally used to. Make sure to get acquainted with the basics if you have trouble understanding the idea of Roles, Purpose, Domains and Accountabilities. Also feel free to contact the Tech circle coordinator if reading about it still doesn't clarify the idea.</p>

  <p>To get tech support, send a message in the #support Slack channel or email us here: <a href="mailto:tech@activisthandbook.org">tech@activisthandbook.org</a></p>
