<p>What will success look like and how will you know when itâ€™s happening? Be sure not to emphasise the outputs that are easiest to count. Focus instead on the outcomes that really matter to your objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Success indicators need to be directly linked to your objectives and might include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Outputs: What quantitative results will be brought about by your activities. What will be the results?</li>
  <li>Outcomes: What changes will be brought about?</li>
  <li>Impact: What will be longer-term results or changes?</li>
  <li>Indicators: How will you know you have achieved your objectives? What are the changes that you will be able to observe?</li>
  <li>Means of verification: How can you prove these changes have occurred?</li>
  <li>Details of how and when the campaign plan will be revised.</li>
  <li>Identify who will be responsible for gathering the data for monitoring success indicators, how they will do it and how regularly reports will be completed.</li>
</ul>
