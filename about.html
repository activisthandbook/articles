<p>Activist Handbook is a Wikipedia-style collaborative manual created by activists, for activists, in <a href="/about/history">2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We <a href="/about/principles">believe</a> that knowledge should be free and available to everyone. We strive to connect globally, learn from various activist undertakings in different political and historical contexts. Cooperation, sharing, diversity and mutuality are important to us. Our organisation aims to support local communities who want to learn from activist experiences from their peers around the globe and share their invaluable experience and practices.</p>

<h1>How we work</h1>
<p>Our organisational structure is inspired by <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/">Holacracy</a>. This way we collaborate decentrally, democratically and effectively. Our organisation is flexible, currently comprising <a href="/about/logbook">six circles</a>, each with a different function. We are all <a href="/about/people">volunteers</a>, working hard to write articles about activism, make our content available in multiple languages, and connect with rebels from all over the world by hosting events and facilitating conversations.</p>
<p>Chapters on this website are available under a <a href="/about/licence">creative commons licence</a> which means that all our content is open to be distributed, edited and built upon by you. The project relies heavily on the contribution of community members and external partners for its content. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we provide an accessible platform that brings together the knowledge and experiences from activists all over the world.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We’re constantly <a href="/join">looking for new members</a>, both in the core circle and in our community of contributors.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>What makes us unique?</h1>
<p>This is what makes Activist Handbook unique:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>We write practical how-to guides</strong>, instead of inspirational/entertaining magazine-like articles.</li>
  <li><strong>We copy other people's work and make it better. </strong>It's not stealing, it is standing on the shoulders of giants.</li>
  <li><strong>We systematically cover any topic that activists are looking for.</strong> Instead of just writing whatever we find interesting, we make use of Google Trends, Search Console Insights and Ahrefs service to find out what people want to know.</li>
  <li><strong>We translate our content in all languages and adapt it to local contexts.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>We organise our content with chapters, sub-topics, tags and lists of related articles:</strong> This makes it easier for people to find the content they are looking for, even if they do not quite know the right search term.</li>
  <li><strong>We publish all our work under a Creative Commons licence.</strong> Other people can redistribute and repurpose our work. It's out there for everyone to use, as long as it is not for commercial purposes.</li>
  <li><strong>We go for quantity first, quality afterwards.</strong> If we think people might be interested in a topic, we will create a page for it, even if we do not have quality content to fill it with. Using our analytics we can then determine whether people are actually interested. In addition, seeing our site is a work in progress, motivates people to contribute.</li>
  <li><strong>We optimise our articles for search engines.</strong>There is no point in writing quality guides if activists cannot find them.</li>
