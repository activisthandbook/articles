<h1><strong>About this strategy</strong></h1>
<p>Even though their goal is to draw attention to and cause changes within the system, the main difference between these and institutional strategies is the level of problem they cause for those in power - they are much more disruptive. Sometimes they can cut supply of important goods and services or prevent institutions from acting the way they usually do. Media usually portray these movements as radical.</p>
