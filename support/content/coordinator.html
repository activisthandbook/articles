<h1>Understanding roles</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Roles <strong>are not</strong> job descriptions. They are dynamic structures made out of 3 components: <strong>purpose, domain and accountabilities</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike jobs, which are driven by task-specific actions (<i>ex: sending e-mails, organizing an event, researching specific topic</i> etc.) roles are driven by their purpose and accountabilities which are focused, but flexible (ex: <i>creating new roles within content circle to delegate tasks whenever one role becomes too much to handle all of its accountabilities; supporting new members of Content circle in fulfilling their role; training a fellow circle member to ensure having a smooth transition in the case of having to find a successor to a role‚Ä¶</i>)</p>
<p>Make sure to check out the ‚ÄúHolacracy for Coordinators‚Äù guide for more detailed explanation on this topic.</p>
