<h1>How to contribute</h1>
<p>You have stumbled upon an empty page. Contribute by working on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discuss the risks of closing off your movement from the outside world (while the inclination to become more secretive to defend yourself against infiltration and surveilance is understandable, you should question whether this is not extactly doing what our oppressors want: hiding in a shell instead of challanging the status quo out in the open).</li>
  <li>Discuss the open &amp; transparent approach we take at Activist Handbook</li>
  <li>Discuss local contexts (e.g. strong history of security culture in the US)</li>
  <li>Discuss steps to take against infiltration &amp; surveilance (while warning not to get paranoid)</li>
</ul>
<h1>External resources</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Many of the existing resources on this topic do not reflect the values of Activist Handbook. We try to take a very open approach in our activism, because we believe this is a more effective change-making strategy.</p>
