<h2>Search keywords</h2>
<p>We have not found many keywords yet that have a high search volume and are also very relevant to Activist Handbook. Generic searches such has ‚Äòhow to get more likes on instagram‚Äô are hard to compete with, since there are already many articles about this topic. These are not necessarily of high quality, but they are all very much optimised for search engines (often promoting some sort of service or product).</p>
