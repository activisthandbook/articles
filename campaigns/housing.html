<p><strong>People all over the world protest for affordable housing. On Activist Handbook, you can find resources on how to organise yourself effectively.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Examples</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dutch housing protests: </strong>There is a huge shortage in affordable housing in the Netherlands. In 2021, over 8000 people in <a href="https://woonopstand.nl/en/">Rotterdam</a> protested for affordable housing. After the protests, several municipalities announced they would start requiring people to live in the houses they buy, to counter slumlords (‘zelfwoonplicht’).</li>
</ul>
<h1>Resources for housing activists</h1>
<p>We have written a chapter on <a href="/organising">how to build a movement</a>, which you can use to learn how to organise yourself effectively to fight for tenant rights together. Become getting right into it by organising a housing protest, we recommend you to think about your <a href="/strategy">long term strategy</a>. Make sure to prepare yourself for a long run, because it can take a while before politicians finally start to hear you. This is why it is also important that you <a href="/wellbeing">do not burn out your volunteers</a>.</p>
<p>Most people immediately think of a protest march, when wanting to bring attention to a cause. However, you can also get creative and check out our <a href="/tactics">tactics</a> chapter. You will need to <a href="/communication">promote your action</a> beforehand. If you do not have a large audience on your social media yet, you use the network of your active volunteers. And remember: your fight likely does not end after one action. You can use actions to recruit new people, so that you can mobilise more for the next one.</p>
