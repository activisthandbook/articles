<p><strong>A protest march is an excellent way to make your voice heard and bring attention to your cause. Here is how you can organise a protest march that will be effective and get the results you want.</strong></p>
<h1>Potential impact</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reach: </strong>in news media, one-on-one conversations</li>
  <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> The more people actively engage with your action (instead of just merely hearing about it or walking by), the more likely you are to recruit new active supporters.</li>
  <li><strong>Disruptiveness: </strong>The more disruptive an action, the more you are forcing decision makers to either respond to your demands or attempt to stop you (eg. by means of police force).<ul>
      <li>You are temporarily <i>taking up a certain physical space</i>, depending on the number of people participating and duration of the march</li>
      <li>You are creating disturbance with <i>noise&nbsp;</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h1>How to organise</h1>
<h2>1. Choose a time and location</h2>
<p>The first step is to choose a time and location for your protest march. Make sure that the time and location are both convenient for as many people as possible. You also want to make sure that the location is easily accessible for the media.</p>
<h2>2. Get a permit</h2>
<p>If you want to march on a public street, you will need to get a permit from the local government. Make sure you do this well in advance, as it can take some time to process the permit.</p>
<h2>3. Plan the route</h2>
<p>The next step is to plan the route for your march. Make sure that the route is safe and easy to follow, and that it ends at a rally or protest site.</p>
