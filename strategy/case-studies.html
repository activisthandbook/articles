  <p>This article needs to be improved:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>⚠️ Please clarify the purpose of the page, otherwise it may be deleted</strong> (all content will still be saved in our version history, so potentially useful pieces of information can still be copied to other pages). All content on Activist Handbook is organised by topic. Any case studies can be added to their relevant topic pages. For example, a case study on communication, can be added to the communication chapter. Consider adding a section to pages where you think case studies may be relevant instead.</li>
  </ul>

<p>What works, when it comes to activism? This is the case studies homepage.</p>
<p>We want to encourage activists and ex-activists to share their experiences and knowledge of particular cases of activism. These could be relating to recent events (as recent as earlier today) or events far back in history. If the case study is experience-based, please only use your experience as a gateway to a more scientific understanding, complete with as many references you can find.</p>
<p>A case study template to help guide activists to record case studies does not yet exist, but feel free to create one.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/template/tactic"><strong>tactic template page</strong></a> is for describing different tactics that activists can use, whereas this page is to describe particular cases of tactics, strategies, organisational models, types of movement, etc etc, which could be from earlier today, or hundreds of years ago.</p>
<p>Please keep case studies objective and scientific, and not about adulating or blaming individuals or groups for things going right or wrong.</p>
<p>Personal, emotional, and expressive accounts of your experiences of activism are extremely valuable for movement building and learning lessons about ourselves and the successes and mistakes of actions, groups and movements, but please record these on the <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/wellbeing/personal-accounts"><strong>Personal Accounts</strong></a><strong> </strong>pages.</p>
<h3>For every type of case study below, please consider:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>What are the exact dates, times, and locations of the case in question?</strong> Please be as specific and accurate as possible.</li>
  <li>What was happening in the wider culture at the time which could have influenced events? (Feel free to use a <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/strategy/intel/PESTLE">PESTLE</a>-style assessment).</li>
  <li>Did the personalities or skills of just one or two individuals have a decisive effect? Is this a problem? (It may be but it doesn't have to be).</li>
  <li>What are the good points? Can you attribute ‘success’ to the subject of the case study, or ‘partial success’?</li>
  <li>If there was ‘no success’ how can we learn from it? (let's remember, nothing is a failure if we learn from it).</li>
  <li>How does the case study relate to other case studies of similar and different subjects?</li>
  <li>How would this case unfold / have unfolded differently in different places, cultures and times?</li>
  <li><strong>What are the main ‘take-aways’ from this case-study?</strong> I.e. what should we replicate, and what should we be careful to avoid? (Case studies can be good warnings against certain behaviours / methods etc)</li>
</ol>
