<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>You and your hub participants will be writing articles for Activist Handbook or improving existing articles. During today‚Äôs training sessions, we will talk about what content we‚Äôre looking for on our website while explaining more about the organisation that we follow in Activist Handbook, we will also give you some tips on how to write good guides and articles. <i>Today‚Äôs training will be </i>divided<i> into four parts:&nbsp;</i></p>
<ol>
  <li><i>First, we‚Äôll talk about <strong>Activist Handbook content, </strong>what kind of articles we write on our website, and of course</i>,<i> we will show you some examples so you can fully understand. We will also talk in this part about our approach in reusing existing resources.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>We will then talk about <strong>Chapter organisation, </strong>this part is basically about how we organise the content </i>on<i> our website in various chapters, and we‚Äôll go through each chapter individually.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>After that, we will discuss <strong>How we can write good articles </strong>for activists by using </i>well-structured<i> sections to organise our ideas while writing.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>And for writing good articles, you definitely need some materials, and that‚Äôs what our 4th part </i>is <i>about, we will go through all the<strong> </strong></i><strong>materials</strong><i><strong> that we provide </strong>for you and for the participants of your hub. And to start working concretely, we will give you a <strong>practice writing exercise.&nbsp;</strong></i></li>
</ol>
<p><i>And to conclude our training, we will do a <strong>Reflection round </strong>&amp; talk about the <strong>Next steps </strong>that are waiting for us.</i></p>
<h1>Activist Handbook content</h1>
<p>So in this first part of the training, we will talk about what kind of articles we publish on Activist Handbook. We will also discuss how exactly all our articles are organised into chapters.</p>
<p><strong>So to get started: what kind of articles will we write during the International Rebel Assembly?</strong></p>
<p><i>‚úÖ </i>We write<strong> <u>practical guides</u> for activists. </strong>So how do you know if your article is a practical guide for activists? Well, they usually answer a question that starts with ‚Äòhow to‚Ä¶‚Äô. So if you are brainstorming about what kind of articles to write, always start with the question ‚Äòhow to‚Ä¶‚Äô. For example: how to organise a campaign, how to reach more people with my Facebook page, and how to get funding for my activist movement.</p>
<p><strong>We do not write:</strong></p>
<p>‚ùå Opinion or advocacy essays. For example: I think we should introduce a carbon tax.</p>
<p>‚ùå Inspirational interviews. For example: Blogs or personal stories.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We are all activists. The people reading Activist Handbook are all activists. We already know that there is a lot of injustice in our society. We don‚Äôt need more motivation to act. We need <u>practical</u> advice that helps us make a positive impact. Chapter organisation</li>
</ul>
<p>So <strong>who are we writing for? </strong>We write for <u>all</u> change-makers</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not write specifically for one cause:<br>‚ùå Climate activists<br>‚ùå Human rights activists<br>‚ùå Women's rights activists</li>
  <li>‚ÄúTo clarify, we do write guides for climate activists, for human rights activists, for women‚Äôs rights activists. But just not for those causes individually. Instead, we try to write guides that are useful for as many activists as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is really important that all of us understand what kind of articles we want to publish on Activist Handbook. So we have provided a few examples that should help you. But if you are not sure if your article ideas would be suitable for Activist Handbook, send us a message.</p>
<p><strong>Example: climate</strong></p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; How to organise a protest</p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; How to use social media effectively</p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; How to deal with climate depression</p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; How to stop the climate crisis ‚Üí <i>too general, you would never be able to write a practical comprehensive guide about this topic.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; Facts about the climate crisis ‚Üí <i>it‚Äôs not a how-to guide for activists</i></p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; I joined a climate protest yesterday ‚Üí<i> it‚Äôs a personal story. Instead, it‚Äôd be better to share any lessons you learned being at that protest in our general guide on how to organise a protest</i></p>
<p><strong>Example: women's rights</strong></p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; How to make my movement inclusive</p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; How to empower women in my movement</p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; Sexism &amp; sexual harassment in activism</p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; Why women's rights are important ‚Üí <i>People reading the handbook are progressive activists, they already know that women‚Äôs rights are important. Instead, talk about what practical things they can do to protect women‚Äôs rights.</i></p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; I want abortion to be protected by law ‚Üí <i>Again, instead talk about what practical things activists could do to advocate the cause that they‚Äôre fighting about.</i></p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; Politicians should listen more to women ‚Üí<i> Politicians are not reading the handbook, activists are. Instead write about how activists can make politicians listen to them.</i></p>
<p><strong>Example: poverty</strong></p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; How to organise crowdfunding</p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; How to apply for subsidy</p>
<p>‚úÖ&nbsp; Free digital tools for activists</p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; The rich should pay more taxes ‚Üí <i>Well, cool, I agree, but this doesn‚Äôt fit in the handbook. Instead talk about how we can make that happen as activists.</i></p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; I want more affordable housing ‚Üí <i>Same story, talk instead about what activists can do</i></p>
<p>‚ùå&nbsp; Why a basic income is a good idea</p>
<h2><strong>New articles vs improving articles</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><i>So another really important thing to know about writing for Activist Handbook is the following: you do not have to write new articles, you can also improve existing articles.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>A lot of us are used to having to write papers for school, starting with a blank page. We think that is stupid. We think it is way more efficient to build upon the work that other people have been doing.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>So if you have a topic that you want to write about that is not on Activist Handbook yet, then of course, fine, you can create a new article. But if there is already an article about the topic, we recommend you to improve that one instead. So all of our articles have a section that is called ‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô. In that section, you will find some advice on how you can improve that page.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reuse the work of others</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><i>And speaking of improving the work of others: even if there is no article about a certain topic on Activist Handbook, there might still be many other articles written on other websites, books or videos about the topic.</i></li>
  <li><i>And we encourage you to reuse that work as well, and </i>incorporate<i>, include it in your article. You can do research online, and then add the most useful information to your article as well.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>However, there is one problem: usually, articles have copyright. This means that you cannot just copy text from those articles into your own, because of legal reasons. Luckily, there is a solution to this problem: the creative commons licence.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>So what is a Creative Commons licence? Well, the author of an article </i>decides<i> that they want to publish their work under a creative commons licence. And if they do that, it means that everyone can reuse their work without any problems. Underneath their article, they will write something like ‚Äòthis article is available under a creative commons licence. If you see that the writer has done that, then you can just copy and paste their work into your article. You only have to credit the original author, by saying in your own article that you reused their work.</i></li>
  <li><i>So let me show you an example of an article that is available under a creative commons licence:</i>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://commonslibrary.org/elections-and-activism-concepts-and-tensions/"><u>https://commonslibrary.org/elections-and-activism-concepts-and-tensions/</u></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i>And like I said before, make sure to credit the original author, in the attribution section of our website. I will also show you an example of what that looks like</i><br><a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/tools/facebook-groups"><u>https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/tools/facebook-groups</u></a></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Writing in your hub</strong></h2>
<p><i>So how will this writing process work during the Rebel Assembly?</i></p>
<p><i>The first step is to <strong>explain to your hub participants how to write good articles</strong>. You will share what we shared with you today with your hub participants. We will prepare materials for you that will help you train your hub participants.</i></p>
<p><i>The next step is to <strong>divide your hub into small groups</strong>. About 2-3 people can work on the same article.</i></p>
<p><i>The third step is to <strong>divide the work so that everyone works on something else</strong>.&nbsp; We recommend you to do it this way, because that way everyone is able to contribute, and everyone will be able to be proud of what they worked on afterwards.</i></p>
<h2><strong>How the content is organised</strong></h2>
<p><i>In this part of the training, we will talk about how we organise all our content into chapters. This is important for you to know because that way you know what kind of content already exists on Activist Handbook. And if participants ask what new articles they could write, or what articles they could improve, you will be able to answer them.</i></p>
<p><i>We will not go very much in detail into all the content that is on Activist Handbook, because it is way too much. But we strongly recommend you to try and visit as many pages on our website after the training, especially the chapters that you are planning on writing for during the event.</i></p>
<h3><i>So how have we organised the content on our website?&nbsp;</i></h3>
<p><i><strong>Our website is organised into various chapters, you will find lots of articles. Sometimes, we also create sub-pages. </strong>Inside your article, we recommend you to link to other articles that are on Activist Handbook. That way, people can more easily find the content they are looking for, and it encourages people to read more. That helps also to organise your work because putting all information on a single page might be too much.</i></p>
<h3><strong>Chapters</strong></h3>
<p><i>To explain further how we organise our website; basically all the content that you can find on Activist Handbook is structured into 8 chapters.</i></p>
<ol>
  <li><i><strong>Theory: </strong>This chapter is about theory of activism. At Activist Handbook, we focus on writing practical guides for activists, but this chapter is a bit of an exception. In this chapter, we explain some difficult terms related to activism, and we explore what they mean from a theoretical perspective. <strong>If you are interested in philosophy, this chapter will be interesting to you. </strong>We answer questions like:</i>
    <ul>
      <li><i>What is activism?</i></li>
      <li><i>Does activism work?</i></li>
      <li><i>Why do we do activism?</i></li>
      <li><i>What does a ‚Äòtheory of change‚Äô mean?</i></li>
      <li><i>What does ‚Äòintersectionality‚Äô mean?&nbsp;</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i><strong>Organising: </strong>This chapter focuses on how to transform a group of individuals into a powerful movement. In other words: we explain how you can make much more impact if you act together with others, if you organise your group well. We talk about :</i>
    <ul>
      <li><i>how to recruit more volunteers,</i></li>
      <li><i>how to keep people engaged,&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>how to work together with other activist organisations,&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>how you can train your fellow activists to become more effective,&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>how to raise funds,&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>how to facilitate meetings so you can make the atmosphere welcoming for everyone</i></li>
      <li><i>And finally we explain how to set up an organisational structure for making decisions, in an effective and fair way</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i><strong>Strategy: </strong>With a good strategy, your movement or campaign makes more impact. We talk about :</i>
    <ul>
      <li><i>how you can find out who has the power to make the change you want to see</i></li>
      <li><i>How you can target them in the most effective way, and force them to listen to you</i></li>
      <li><i>How you can find out who are your allies, and who are your opponents</i></li>
      <li><i>What kind of tactics to use to achieve your goals</i></li>
      <li><i>How you can evaluate if what you‚Äôre doing is effective</i></li>
      <li><i>In this chapter, we also provide you with some workshops that activists can organise to make an impactful strategy together with their fellow movement members. We also talk about some strategies that other activists are using, so you can get inspired.</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i><strong>Tactics: </strong>This chapter is a continuity to the previous one because you won‚Äôt be able to choose a tactic without your strategy; your tactics will be based on your strategy. In this chapter, we have a very long list of all sorts of different tactics. For example, we talk about:</i>
    <ul>
      <li><i>How to organise a protest march</i></li>
      <li><i>How to organise a blockade</i></li>
      <li><i>How to paint banners</i></li>
      <li><i>How to set up a blockade</i></li>
      <li><i>How to organise a civil disobedience action</i></li>
      <li><i>How to use art and music as a form of protest</i></li>
      <li><i>We explain to the readers that it is important to use creative tactics, because that way you will more easily get the attention of news media and politicians. For each tactic, we explain in steps how to organise it from beginning to end.</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i><strong>Wellbeing: </strong>This chapter is basically about taking care of fellow change-makers and how to safeguard their wellbeing, their mental and physical health.</i><br><i>In the process of trying to make a change, you might forget about your own wellbeing.&nbsp;</i><br><i>But you need to know that your wellbeing and the wellbeing of your fellow change-makers is vital for the long term effectiveness of your movement.&nbsp;</i><br><i>This chapter is basically about how to prevent burnout, how to deal with anxiety and stress, how to give first aid during protests.</i></li>
  <li><i><strong>Communication: </strong>It‚Äôs all about making sure that your message comes across. This chapter discusses how to keep in touch with your fellow activists, how to formulate a message for your target audience and how to reach out to the press. We talk about:</i>
    <ul>
      <li><i>How to get people involved with your movement, from the very first time they hear about you on social media, to communicate with them using chat messages and newsletters once they are more active members.</i></li>
      <li><i>How to use inclusive language</i></li>
      <li><i>How to create illustrations and a certain design language/visual language that stands out and which people can easily recognise.&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>And to share your message more effectively, you need to know what platforms you should use, for example: instagram, facebook, twitter, reddit, tiktok, chat apps (such as WhatsApp, Telegram..), SMS campaigns, phone banking.</i></li>
      <li><i>We also talk about how you can make sure your actions get picked up by news media, by learning how to write good press releases.</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><i><strong>Digital tools: </strong>It consists of digital tools that activists can use for their movements, I‚Äôve already talked about few of communication tools in the previous chapter, such as social media and chat apps, but there are other applications that can help you if you need pictures to post on your socials like: Wikimedia Commons Images, FreeImages, Open Peeps and many other amazing tools.</i><br><i>There are also some other productivity apps that help you organise your files and documents, create some good presentations and all sort of collaborative documents. We also talk about how you can set up a website for your movement, and how to take into account issues such as privacy and digital security.</i></li>
  <li><i><strong>Legal rights: A</strong>s an activist, knowing your legal rights is an enormously powerful tool to have when dealing with authorities. In this chapter, we talk about what are the legal protections that activists have. We also discuss in this chapter how police and law enforcement usually treat activists. Of course, laws and police practices are different in every country, so we have guides that describe your local context. Examples of laws that protect the rights of activists are the right to protest,<strong> </strong></i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly"><i><strong>freedom of assembly</strong></i></a><i><strong>, </strong></i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association"><i><strong>freedom of association</strong></i></a><i><strong>, </strong>and the right to<strong> </strong></i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech"><i><strong>freedom of speech</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></li>
</ol>
<h1>How to write good articles</h1>
<p><i>In this part of the training, we will discuss how you can write good articles that are helpful to activists around the globe. We will talk about how you can structure your articles, we will give you some general tips &amp; tricks, and we will show you some </i>real-world<i> examples of articles that are already on our website right now.</i></p>
<h2><strong>Structure of articles, article sections</strong></h2>
<p><i>So let‚Äôs start by showing you how we organise our articles, using a default set of sections that are in every article. Every article has a title, subtitle, introduction, a main section with headings and subheadings, an ‚ÄòImprove this page‚Äô section, some related articles on Activist Handbook, some external resources and an attribution section. Let me go through each of them now to explain what all of them are, and why they are important to include in your article.</i></p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/support/writers/structure"><u>https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/support/writers/structure</u></a></li>
</ul>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Title &amp; subtitle</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Short (under 30 characters)</li>
  <li>The reader should be able to understand what the article is about, even if they don‚Äôt know anything about the topic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good examples:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‚úÖ Organise election campaign</p>
<p>‚úÖ Social media for activists</p>
<p>‚úÖ Write press release</p>
<p><strong>Bad examples:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>‚ùå ToC for activists (avoid abbreviation, not clear what this article is about)</p>
<p>‚ùå Writing a Theory of Change: six important lessons for activists (too long, clickbait)</p>
<p>‚ùå From Single Roads to Crossways - Adopting an Intersectional Approach (too creative, way too long, not to the point)</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Tell the reader what the article is about</li>
  <li>Outline its contents.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Max 4 sentences</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good example</strong></p>
<p>‚úÖ In this guide, you will learn how to organise a protest or demonstration. This article for activists explains step by step how to organise an action to draw attention to your cause.</p>
<p><strong>Bad example</strong></p>
<p>‚ùå I once organised a successful climate protest, and now I will tell you how to organise one too.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Main content: (sub)headings</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Short, should tell the reader what</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Good example</strong></p>
<p>‚úÖ Mobilise people for protest (in an article on how to organise a protest)</p>
<p>‚úÖ Talk about your feelings (in an article about wellbeing)</p>
<p><strong>Bad example</strong></p>
<p>‚ùå Getting organised: how mobilise people for a protest from A to B</p>
<p>‚ùå Positive Expression</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Improve this page</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Add instructions on how other people could improve that guide in the future</li>
  <li>Search engine keywords: things that people look up in Google often, which indicates to us how many people are interested in that topic. That way, we can prioritise topics that lots of people have questions about, so we can help as many activists as possible.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><i>Again: we highly recommend you to try and improve existing guides that we have on our website.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Related articles</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>List of similar articles on Activist Handbook</li>
