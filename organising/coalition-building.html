<p><strong>In this article you will learn how to build coalitions between movements. Together we stand stronger.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The long history of activism has shown that it is crucial to communicate, cooperate and become more connected when it comes to movements. It is not only beneficial to the main goal, which is desired to be achieved but also to the movement itself, for its members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, the more cooperation we have, the better it is for achieving common goals. Building and creating strong connections is going to help us make a powerful “web” of activists all across the globe, therefore the process of achieving goals is going to be significantly faster and lessoverwhelming. This is a global aspect which is considered as the main reason when talking about “Why should we establish and develop stronger relations between movements?”. But there are also many other, not that “surface-level” kind of aspects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a noticeable tendency that the left is more divided than right. It also really affects social, political and other movements in a bad way. But it is important to remember - even though many movements may have similar but not the same goals, it is still important to find compromises rather than arguing whether the goals the other movement is having are valuable. It is about setting priorities. Prioritizing achieving goals, enjoying the process rather than prioritizing aggressive arguing, conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>Also important to mention- creating tighter relations between movements is going to be relevant for exchanging experience, making the work process more productive. Basically cooperation and supporting each other is going to help developing movements faster and in a more effective way. It also kind of contributes to the idea of the strong web of activists.</p>
<p>Recap. How to achieve tighter relations between movements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finding compromises</li>
  <li>Discussing but not arguing</li>
  <li>Highlighting common goals</li>
  <li>More joint activities (study sessions, projects, meetings)</li>
</ul>
