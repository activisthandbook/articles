<p><strong>This chapter contains a list of various tactics that activists use to make change happen. Note that you do not have to choose one particular tactic. The most successful movements use a combination of tactics and allow people to contribute to the cause in their own way.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1>Take collective action</h1>
<p>No matter what tactic you decide to use, we highly recommend you to read our guide with practical steps to <a href="organise-protest"><strong>organise a collective action</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you are planning on doing, you should do it together with others. If you want to achieve big change, you need big numbers. Do not let this discourage you though: you can start off with a very small group. In fact, especially small groups are able to come up with creative ideas and adapt quickly to changing circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Start organising small, build towards something big. Radical change starts small. If you would like to learn how to become the spark that ignites the fire, also make sure to check out our <a href="/organising">organising chapter</a>.</p>

<h1>Choose your tactic</h1>
<p>You should pick your tactics based on your <a href="/strategy">strategy</a>. To help you get started, we created four broad categories. Tactics may fall under multiple categories.</p>

<h2><strong>Protests ‚úä</strong></h2>
