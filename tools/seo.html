<p><strong>In this guide for nonprofits, we help you optimise the search engine performance of your movement's website. To make it easier for your supporters to find you on Google, we also provided some tools for activists to analyse your website and search analytics.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Why is SEO important?</strong></h1>
<p>People use search engines like Google as a primary source of information. If you want people to find out about your digital campaigns, optimising your website to end up higher in the search rankings can really help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online activism is not a replacement of real-life activism, as it is very much reliant on big tech. However, we believe that we can use their own capitalist tools against them. In this article we explain how to end up high in the search results – not to make profit, but to change this world for the better.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <i>At Activist Handbook, we write guides for change-makers. However, there is no point in writing an article about how to organise a protest, if no-one can find it. In addition, we use search analytics to determine what topics activists are interested in.</i></p>
<h1><strong>Ranking criteria</strong></h1>
<p>The following things are taken into account by search engines like Google to determine if your webpage should show up high in the search results:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>High quality content</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Relevant topics &amp; intent</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Quality website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Below we explain what each of these mean in detail.</p>
<h2><strong>High quality content</strong></h2>
<p>Google tries its best to serve people the best content. How do they know? We do not really know, their algorithm is mostly a secret. Make sure to read their own <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide">Google SEO guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short: <strong>Google does not really want to you optimise your website for Google</strong>, because that fucks up their algorithm. Instead, they want you to optimise your content for the reader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you to do exactly that: if you do not really know how to do SEO well, your best guess is just to create content that people like. Chances are that Google will like it too. These are some things that Google looks at:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do people like your content?</strong> For example, they try to determine this by how many people are sharing links to your site. This can be other people adding a link to your website from their own site (backlinks), or people sharing your content on social media.</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content well-written? </strong>Grammar &amp; spelling mistakes</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content well organised?</strong> Headings, links,</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content unique?</strong> Brings new value to readers</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content complete? </strong>Avoid very short articles</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Relevant topics &amp; intent</strong></h2>
<p>You should <strong>write about things that people are interested in</strong>. If you want people to find your article via search engines, there is no point in writing a super high quality article about a topic that nobody looks up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>avoid too general topics</strong>. There will likely already be many articles, and it will be harder to show up high in the search results.</p>
<p>The perfect topic is frequently looked up, but no high quality articles exist about it yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google tries to figure out the <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-intent/"><strong>intent</strong></a> of the person typing in the search query. In other words: what result are they looking for? Those websites will show up higher in the search results.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>For example, someone from Berlin looking up ‘protest today’, probably would like to read news articles about a certain protest that is happening that day in Berlin. Thus, Google will favour webpages from German news websites that have been written on that day. On the other hand, someone looking up ‘how to organise protest’ probably wants a practical guide, which is what Google will show in the results.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Quality of website</strong></h2>
<p>Google also takes into account website <u>loading time</u>, <u>accessiblity</u>, and whether it is optimised for <u>mobile phones</u>. These factors directly impact your search rank. As a writer, these things may be difficult to work on, so this part is mostly useful for developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good start is to analyse the quality of your website using a <a href="https://web.dev/measure/">page analysis tool</a>. This tool scans your website, and also shows real world data collected by Google Chrome.</p>
<p>Some other factors to take into account:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crawl</strong>: To be included in the search results, search engines must first be able to find and crawl your website.</li>
  <li><strong>User experience</strong>: Avoid spammy popups and annoying ads.</li>
  <li><strong>Title, URL and description</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Snippets &amp; structured data</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1>Tools for SEO</h1>
<p>We know most activists do not have a pile of money laying around. We have made a list of free and inexpensive tools that you can use for search engine optimisation.</p>
<h2>Website analytics</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Google Analytics</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Matomo (privacy-friendly alternative)</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Want the most feature-rich solution? Choose Google Analytics. Care about privacy? Use Matomo.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Content &amp; website optimisation</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Keyword research</h2>
<p>If you want people to find your website, you should write about things that people are looking up. And if you want to show up high in the search rankings, write about topics that other websites have not yet produced high-quality content for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some features to look out for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Suggestions for new keywords:</strong> helps you brainstorm and find keywords that people look up most (based on your input: a keyword, your website or competitors' websites)</li>
  <li><strong>Search query popularity: </strong>the frequency with which people look up certain keywords (globally or in a certain location/language)</li>
  <li><strong>Difficulty to rank for keywords: </strong>how likely it is that you will show up high in the search results, based on competing webpages for that keyword</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <h1>Our recommendations</h1>
  <p>Since all these keyword tools are free or freemium, we recommend you to use a combination to make sure of the best features from each.</p>
  <p>For example, use the following <strong>recommended</strong> <strong>workflow</strong>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Explore keywords:</strong> Use Answer the Public to get a general overview of all possible search queries related to one topic. Then use AlsoAsked to find and organise subtopics in a structured way. If there is an active Reddit community for your topic, also use Keyworddit.</li>
    <li><strong>Get detailed keyword info:</strong> Use Semrush and Ahrefs to get detailed information about the search volume and ranking difficulty of one particular search query. Data is based on estimates, so less accurate.</li>
    <li><strong>Get accurate comparitive data: </strong>Use Google Trends to compare the popularity of several keywords over time and in different geographical areas. Info is based on data collected by Google, so of high accuracy.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<h3>Google Trends</h3>
<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> has limited functionality but has the highest reporting accuracy (based on actual Google data). It is useful when you want to compare several keywords, want to see how their popularity changes over time, or if you want to find similar keywords.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> 100% free</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed:</strong> no</li>
  <li><strong>Features:</strong> It shows keyword popularity on a scale of 0 to 100 instead of the actual number of searches (which makes this tool much less useful), a timeline of search volume, a map with search volume, and related queries.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>AlsoAsked</strong></h3>
<p>AlsoAsked is useful for finding <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/long-tail-keywords">long-tail keywords</a> (full questions, instead of just a few words). &nbsp;It bases its data on Google's “People Also Ask” data that appear in Google search results, and organises them in a logical way.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> Freemium. You get 3 free searches per month (definitely do not open an incognito window).</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed:</strong> no</li>
  <li><strong>Features:</strong> find out what questions people have about a certain topic</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Answer the Public</strong></h3>
<p>Answer the Public looks similar to AlsoAsked. However, it differs in that it uses the Google suggested search queries instead of the “People Also Ask” box. Their differences are explained in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4IbchVW7Y">video</a> made by AlsoAsked.</p>
<p>We recommend you to use Answer the Public to get a basic overview of all searches related to a certain topic, and then AlsoAsked to do more detailed research.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> Freemium</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed:</strong> no</li>
  <li><strong>Features:</strong> find out what questions people have about a certain topic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Semrush</h3>
<p>Using a free account, you will be able to use the <a href="https://www.semrush.com/analytics/keywordoverview/">Semrush Keyword Overview</a>. You will find detailed results for every&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> Freemium. 10 free searches daily (definitely do <i>not</i> make multiple accounts)</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed:</strong> yes</li>
  <li><strong>Features:&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Ahrefs</strong></h3>
<p>Ahrefs offers two free tools for keyword research: <a href="https://ahrefs.com/keyword-generator">Keyword Generator </a>and <a href="https://ahrefs.com/keyword-difficulty">Keyword Difficulty Checker</a>. You will have to pass an annoying <i>I’m not a robot</i> test for every keyword you look up, but you can look up unlimited keywords. Data is also limited to the first few keyword results, unless you buy the (very expensive) subscription.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price: </strong>Freemium.</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed: </strong>no</li>
  <li><strong>Features:&nbsp;</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Using the keyword generator you will get a list of suggested keywords based on your keyword input. For the first few, you can see their volume and difficulty.</li>
      <li>Using the Keyword difficulty checker, you get more detailed info about how difficult it is to get your page to rank high for a certain keyword (showing the required amount of backlinks). You can also see what the search results look like (for the selected country).</li>
      <li>For both, it is not possible to look up the global volume of a keyword.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Keyworddit</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> 100% free</li>
  <li><strong>Account needed: </strong>no</li>
  <li><strong>Features:</strong> For Reddit keyword research, based on a subreddit</li>

<h1>Google ad grant for nonprofits</h1>
<p>Google offers a $10.000 monthly <a href="https://www.google.com/grants/get-started/">ad grant</a> to eligible nonprofit organisations. You can use this grant to advertise your webpages in the Google search results for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, keep into account that search engine optimisation is still important, even if you use ads. Google actually still looks at your page quality when using search ads, so more relevant webpages will be shown more prominently and in turn receive more ad clicks.</p>
<h1>Improve this page</h1>
<p>This page about SEO is written by activists like you, and you can help make it better. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using SEO as activist tactic: bringing your message to the public through search engines (perhaps to compete with politicians or companies that you are targeting?)</li>
  <li>Linking to a guide about privacy considerations when using tools like Google Analytics</li>
  <li>Perhaps create separate guides about each of the tools (for example: ‘Semrush for nonprofits’), and a separate page about the Google ad grant (though the latter is harder to rank high for).</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are people looking up?</h2>
<p>Originally, the title of this page was ‘search engine optimisation for activists'. However, almost nobody looks up that search query.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a difficult query to compete for: most people writing articles about this topic are very skilled in search engine optimisation, so it is hard to get this article high in the results. There are also many ads for SEO services and tools.</p>
