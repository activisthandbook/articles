<p>On the left side of the diagram are strategies that focus primarily on the people and communities, not the institutions. The more lenient type is what we named <i><strong>Cultural</strong></i> strategies. These focus on training, education, awareness campaigns, information dissemination etc. Their primary goal is to strengthen individuals and communities, change behaviour, values or attitudes of people.</p>
