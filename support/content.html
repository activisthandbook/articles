<p>Welcome to the Content Circle, the place where the activists become writers and researchers. The idea of our circle is peer to peer education, so ideally we want to make sure that what we write is not only accurate, but also relevant and useful to activists from all over the world.</p>
<p>We also intend to facilitate the cooperation between writers and help them find partners or teams for co-writing. We strongly believe in working together, sharing knowledge, resources and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Activist Handbook, we're using <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/support/organisation">Holacracy</a>, a way of organising we're not normally used to. Make sure to get acquainted with the basics if you have trouble understanding the idea of Roles, Purpose, Domains and Accountabilities.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Create state of the art guides for activists all over the world</p>

<p>Content Circle presides over <strong>Chapters </strong>on our website. Although we want to stay an open source platform of writers we have to make sure that the content on the website is in line with the necessary minimum of rules presented in <a href="write">guidelines for writers</a>.</p>
