<h1>Writing a strategy together&nbsp;</h1>
<p>We have written several articles to help you write a strategy for your movement. We have added step-by-step guides for organising workshop sessions to start writing a strategy together with fellow rebels.</p>
<h2>Templates &amp; workgroup guides</h2>
<p>There is no ‚Äúone right way‚Äù to capture and communicate all the elements of strategy. &nbsp;Some organisations have a preference for simple one-page tables. Others use longly narrative formats or complex documents that extend to 20 pages or more. &nbsp;Some templates we‚Äôve seen used effectively are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-strategy-chart/"><strong>tCA strategy chart</strong></a>: The anatomy of a campaign strategy: a chart illustrating elements of strategy and processes your group can use to develop them.</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-campaign-strategy-template/"><strong>tCA campaign strategy template</strong></a>: a template incorporating elements of strategy and suggested processes to develop each element with members of your group</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/basic-strategy-grid/"><strong>Basic strategy grid</strong></a>: An adapted version of the Midwest Academy‚Äôs community organising grid, this simple table provides one way of developing and integrating key pieces of a strategy in a logical sequence.</li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/tca-strategy-grid/"><strong>tCA strategy grid</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://thechangeagency.org/strategic-planning-template-2/"><strong>Strategic planning template</strong></a>: This format has been used by medium-sized environment groups in their annual planning cycle. A simple table requiring vision, objectives, resources and performance indicators. The table is also useful for evaluation purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Background: Strategy models</h1>

<ul>
  <li><i>What are the various aspects of strategy models? (e.g. ideals, goals, theory of change, differentiation between allies/opponents)</i></li>
  <li><i>What model does Activist Handbook follow? Make sure to make clear that there is not one single model that should be used by activists.&nbsp;</i></li>

  <figcaption><strong>Vancouver Town Hall </strong>‚Äì<strong> </strong>From May 17th to the end of June, communities across Canada held over 150 town halls across the country to build a Green New Deal for Canada. A Green New Deal is an ambitious vision for tackling the climate crisis, seeing the full implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Right to Free Prior and Informed Consent and the TRC recommendations implemented, while creating millions of jobs and leaving no one behind in the process. It is a bold plan to retool our economy at the scale that science and justice demand. That means mass government investment to build a 100% renewable energy economy created safer, healthier communities for all of us.his kind of ambitious plan means a transformative policy platform that stretches across sectors and jurisdictions. And that is why we needed all hands on deck to design it.
