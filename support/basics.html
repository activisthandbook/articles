<p><strong>We're so excited to welcome you to our team! To help you get started, we have written a few support articles. At the very least, we highly recommend you to read this page.</strong></p>

<h1>First steps</h1>
<p>To become active as volunteer for Activist Handbook, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Getting started with a video call: </strong>After you have applied for a role, you will receive an invitation from one of our coordinators to set up a video call. This is not an interview, we just want to get to know you and see how you would like to contribute to this project.</li>
  <li><strong>Officially </strong><a href="https://airtable.com/shrbfrxknihy8mYXe"><strong>register</strong></a><strong> as volunteer.</strong></li>
  <li><a href="http://slack.com/download"><strong>Download Slack</strong></a><strong> and turn on </strong><a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-nl/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications"><strong>notifications</strong></a>. Our integrator will add you to channels that are relevant to you. Our tech circle is happy to help you get started with Slack: <a href="tech@activisthandbook.org">tech@activisthandbook.org</a></li>
</ol>
<h1>How we are organised</h1>
<p>As volunteer, you will work closely together with other members of Activist Handbook. In short, this is how we are organised.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Circles: </strong>We work together in groups of people, which we call <i>circles</i>. For example, we have a communication circle, which is responsible for managing our social media, recruiting volunteers and welcoming newcomers.</li>
  <li><strong>Roles: </strong>Within these circles, we give people specific <i>roles</i>. Every role has a clearly defined purpose, domain and accountabilities. This way, everyone knows what to do and what to expect of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to read our article about <a href="/support/organisation">how we are organised</a> to learn more.</p>
<h1><strong>How we meet</strong></h1>
<p>We meet on a regular basis online. You are expected to attend your circle meetings. In addition, we have organisation wide meetings which you are very much welcome to join. Check out our <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y29udGFjdEBhY3RpdmlzdGhhbmRib29rLm9yZw"><strong>calendar</strong></a> for all upcoming meetings and events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our meetings are very much structured so that we can work more effectively. You will learn more about this as you attend them, but also feel free to read our support article about <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/support/meetings">how we meet</a>.</p>
<h1>Learn more</h1>
<p>We find it extremely important to support our volunteers in the best way possible. We have written various other <a href="/support/website"><strong>support articles</strong></a>, both general and specifically for your role.</p>
<p>In addition, feel free to ask any questions you may have in our #support Slack channel. You can also send us an email at: <a href="mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org">contact@activisthandbook.org</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>As a final important note:</strong><i><strong> </strong>our support articles are written by our volunteers. We expect from you that you write or improve support articles about your role, so that your successor does not have to start from zero.</i></p>
