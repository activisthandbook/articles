<p><strong><u>Palettes</u></strong></p>
<p>One good way to ensure professionalism is through use of colors for a certain purpose. Palettes are a color scheme for social media posts, aimed at standardizing background and text colors. Using these ensures that there’s a throughline between related posts, such as using a certain palette (with associated colors) for a single campaign or event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using palettes is good practice in creating more of a brand identity. Palettes also ensure that colors used in a post largely work together, and don’t create any unfortunate difficulties, especially for those with visual disabilities</p>
