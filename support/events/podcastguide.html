<ul>
  <li>You do not have an audience yet.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Give your audience a reason to listen</h3>
<p>If you know who your audience is you can ask yourself why they should listen to your podcast.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Decide on a format</h2>
<p>What format will bring acrross your message best?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>A solo or monologue podcast</li>
  <li>A co-hosted or conversation style podcast with two or more hosts</li>
  <li>An interview style podcast with one or more guest speakers</li>
  <li>A panel or roundtable style podcast</li>
  <li>A documentary or narrative storytelling style podcast</li>
  <li>A repurposed content style podcast</li>

<h1>Recording the podcast</h1>
<p>Once you know the concept of the podcast you can begin with recording. Making sure your recordings are of good quality can be challenging if you have little experience making podcasts. These are some low budget suggestions:</p>
<h2>Where are you recording?</h2>
<p>Do you have a room available for recording your podcast? Or will you record while you are on a stroll. And how about guests that join via a call?</p>
<h3>Recording in a room</h3>
<p>The room you record in affects the quality of the recording. The most immportant aspects to consider are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does the room create a reverb or echo? Avoid large and empty rooms to prevent reverb. Soft materials such as carpets, curtains and big furnitures minimise rerverb by absorbing and diffusing the sound.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Is the room silent? Avoid background noises that distract from the recording. Some things to keep in mind are notification sounds, outside noises and your computers ventilator.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Record the room tone. Every room has a sound. By recording about 10 seconds of silence. A lot of sound editing software have a noise canceling tool. This enables you to filter this static room tone out of the rest of the recording when editing the recording.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>What microphone do you use?</h2>
<h3>External mics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>earpieces, headsets, usb mics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inbuilt mics</h3>
<p>Another possibility is using the inbuilt mic of a device such as your phone or a computer. The application you are using to record has influence on the quality as well.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recomended recording applications (audacity, garageband)</li>
  <li>Podcast applications: usually paid subscription, make it easy for you to record, edit and publish podcasts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Investing in a mic</h3>
<p>These are some suggestions to look for in a mic:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamic microphones</li>
  <li>USB and XLR connections</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recording online interviews</h3>
<ul>
