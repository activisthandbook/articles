<p>When you map out the stakeholders in your campaign,&nbsp;<strong>allies</strong>&nbsp;are the stakeholders you can work with, build alliances with, and share resources with.&nbsp;<strong>Constituents</strong>&nbsp;are “the community”: the people you want to side with your position and help apply pressure to your target. Your&nbsp;<strong>target</strong>&nbsp;is often a decision maker: someone who can give you the change you want. In representative democracies these are often politicians, ministers, or members of parliament. Sometimes we have limited capacity to influence our primary targets, so it can useful to identify secondary targets: stakeholders who have more direct influence with the primary target. If your primary target is the CEO of a corporation, then your secondary targets might include shareholders.</p>
<p>A power map can be a useful reference and shared analysis during a campaign. This is a simple tool to identify where key stakeholders (allies, targets, opponents and constituents) stand in relation to your campaign objective, and their relative levels of influence.</p>
