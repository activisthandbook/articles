<p>When writing articles, we might want to explain certain concepts, use of words, or stress a caveat. You can use either asterisk (*) or numbers (1) (2) … (n) in case you will be using multiple footnotes. The related footnotes are placed at the bottom of the main article, before chapters and other links in the section titled “Footnotes”. Examples can be found in the article <a href="/en/wellbeing/riot-medicine/field-guide"><i>Riot Medicine.</i></a></p>
<p>When quoting external resources such as papers, articles, videos or podcasts we use the <a href="https://www.scribbr.com/apa-style/in-text-citation/">APA syle</a> format. This is a recent change, the Activist Handbook website needs to adapt to this new change ASAP.</p>
<h1>Captioning illustrations</h1>
<p>Illustrations are integral parts of most of our articles. They can be pulled directly&nbsp;from resources or from one of the free libraries. We have a section on the website dedicated to <a href="/en/tools/photo-video">free libraries of illustrations for activists</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you add an illustration you will be given an option to edit the captions at the bottom. We recommend the following format of the caption:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Image Title by Author (Year).</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of this type of captioning can be found in the article <a href="/en/organising/start-a-movement"><i>Start a movement</i></a>.</p>
<h1>Adding resources</h1>
<p>The first step when writing a new article is to collect resources. Resources can be external articles, books, movies, and more. Here are a few tips when collecting resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make clear what kind of resource it is</strong> by adding the type between brackets after the title like so: <i>Title Of Resource <u>[movie/video/book]</u></i></li>
  <li><strong>Make clear what in what language(s) the resource is available</strong> when it is in a different language than the page it is on. Add it between brackets after the title like so: <i>Titel Van Artikel <u>[Deutch/Nederlands]</u></i></li>
  <li><strong>Make sure to archive the resource. </strong>This way, even if the original link breaks (for example, when the link changes or the page is deleted), users will still be able to access the resource. Use <a href="https://web.archive.org">web.archive.org</a> to archive web pages.</li>
</ul>
