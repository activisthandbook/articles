<p><strong>In this article we explain why it is important to think about the strategy that you use for your movement or campaign.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h1>You need a strategy</h1>
<p>The purpose of a strategy is to help you determine the best approach to achieving your goals based on the situation you‚Äôre in, your values as well as your strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Add more information here why developing a clear strategy is important‚Ä¶</i></p>
<h1>Components of strategy</h1>
<p>There are many different methods of strategy building but they generally agree on<a href="https://effectiveactivist.com/planning/"><u> six basic components of a strategy</u></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúA strategy for a social change campaign can be as simple or complex as you and your group determine. It should communicate your theory of change, the political context you are working in, the problems and solutions, your goals and objectives, power analysis, tactics and timeline.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>Your idea of a Utopia. It might sound silly to imagine an ideal world that doesn‚Äôt exist, but the image of that world is the best way for you to make sure you share people in your organization or movement share values and vision of what you‚Äôre trying to achieve. Sharing visions between activist movements is a good way of building relationships and developing networks of camaraderie.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our goals are the checkpoints along the way toward our vision, getting us closer and closer to the world we want to live in.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As we said in the first passage, the choice of strategy depends on the purpose and long-term goals. Unlike vision, goals should indeed be achievable, and when thinking about them, we should keep them realistic. This means we should be able to answer the questions about our own experience and skill level, capacities, as well as the nature of our political and social environment. Tactics and strategies that worked in the past don‚Äôt necessarily have to work for us. The same goes for tactics that work in different political environments today. <a href="https://thechangeagency.org/strategy/"><u>This article</u></a> can help you learn about some of the tools you can use to answer these questions.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>The best way of understanding objectives without confusing them with goals is to identify them as specific tasks that explain exactly how the goals are achieved. Objectives are the most specific elements of strategies and are mostly used to decide on action plans.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Targets</h2>
<p>These are, in the context of strategy, always people. Whether the politicians whose decisions we‚Äôre trying to influence, or managers of companies who leave us no choice but to organize a strike. Bear this in mind when thinking about targets. You want to know the culture, goals and purpose of institutions you‚Äôre aiming to put pressure on. Targets can be broadly categorized as <strong>primary </strong>and <strong>secondary</strong>, primary being the decision-makers you want to influence and secondary being all potential allies and people who would benefit from the changes you‚Äôre trying to install as well as people with influence over the issue who are not decision-makers (institutions).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>Tactics are something we have <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/tactics"><u>an entire chapter</u></a> about. They are, in a nutshell, concrete series of actions that we plan and execute in order to meet our strategic goals. Depending on your strategies some tactics might be more relevant than others. Different tactics attract people with different values and have varying degrees of success. Make sure not to confuse tactics and values. <i>Solidarity</i> or <i>youth participation</i> aren't tactics, those are values that tactics such as cooperatives or student parliaments might help strengthen.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Measures of success</h2>
<p>The least fun but still essential part of the entire planning is the measurement of success. We want to have reliable ways of evaluating our own success and that can help us see our weak spots so we can improve them. Metrics play a very important role in this type of measurement.</p>
