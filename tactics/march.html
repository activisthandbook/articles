<p><strong>A protest march is an excellent way to make your voice heard and bring attention to your cause. Here is how you can organise a protest march that will be effective and get the results you want.</strong></p>
<h1>Steps to organise a march</h1>
<h2>1. Choose a time and location</h2>
<p>The first step is to choose a time and location for your protest march. Make sure that the time and location are both convenient for as many people as possible. You also want to make sure that the location is easily accessible for the media.</p>
<h2>2. Get a permit</h2>
<p>If you want to march on a public street, you will need to get a permit from the local government. Make sure you do this well in advance, as it can take some time to process the permit.</p>
<h2>3. Plan the route</h2>
<p>The next step is to plan the route for your march. Make sure that the route is safe and easy to follow, and that it ends at a rally or protest site.</p>
