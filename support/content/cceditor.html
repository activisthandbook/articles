<h1>Your role</h1>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> As creative commons editor, your domain is the “creative commons library”. Your main goal is to update this library with new resources that are under creative commons (CC) and public domain licenses as well as leading the effort of integrating this content on our website as articles withing chapters.</p>
<p><strong>Role components: </strong>Find the exact purpose, domain and accountabilities of this role in <a href="https://airtable.com/shr6GqOJ7587fNbEn/tbloV4g8loVisebVz?filter_Role=Creative%20commons%20editor">Airtable</a>.</p>
<h1>Integrating external content</h1>
<p>Activist Handbook doesn't want to reinvent the wheel. Just like Wikipedia, we collect and reference readily available content on activism, and using creative commons and public domain content saves us a lot of time on research and writing of original articles. That way our teams of writers can focus on exploring topics that lack visibility and haven't been written about before.</p>
