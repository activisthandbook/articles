<p><strong>In this guide for activists, we help you optimise the search engine performance of your movement's website. To make it easier for your supporters to find you on Google, here are some tools for activists to analyse your website's search performance.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Why SEO is important for activists</strong></h1>
<p>People use search engines like Google as a primary source of information. If you want people to find out about your digital campaigns, optimising your website to end up higher in the search rankings can really help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Online activism is not a replacement of real-life activism, as it is very much reliant on big tech. However, we believe that we can use their own capitalist tools against them. In this article we explain how to end up high in the search results â€“ not to make profit, but to change this world for the better.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <i>At Activist Handbook, we write guides for change-makers. However, there is no point in writing an article about how to organise a protest, if no-one can find it. In addition, we use search analytics to determine what topics activists are interested in.</i></p>
<h1>Improve search results</h1>
<p>Factors contributing to ending up higher in the search results:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Content relevancy:</strong> High quality content that answers questions that people are looking up.</li>
  <li><strong>Backlinks: </strong>other websites linking to your site</li>
  <li><strong>Social media activity:</strong> people sharing and engaging with your content on social media</li>
  <li><strong>Technical aspects:</strong> optimised for mobile phones, quick loading times, accessibility</li>
</ul>
