</blockquote>
<p>If you are reaching out to them via a private message, we recommend to keep it shorter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hey [name], I'm [name] from Activist Handbook. We are building a Wikipedia-like platform for activists all over the world to exchange knowledge and experiences. We would love to work together with [organisation]!<br><br><i>How about we schedule a video call sometime soon, so we can get to know each other a bit &amp; talk about how we could join forces?&nbsp;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they respond positively, you can reply:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Awesome!<i> Let's pick a date for a video call. Could you share your availability here? </i><a href="https://calendly.com/activisthandbook/partner">https://calendly.com/activisthandbook/partner</a></p>

<h1>Script video call partners</h1>
<p>There is a <a href="https://forms.gle/CzJoF95HhpppNG5J8"><strong>partnership script</strong></a> that you can follow during a video call with potential partners. Simply follow the instructions in the form and fill in any answers that the representative of the organisation may give. A call takes about 15 to 30 minutes. You should also reseverve some time (5/10 mins) after the video call to send a follow-up message.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is recommended to go through the form and practice with someone else before using it with one of our potential partners.</li>
    <li>The script is written for conversations with people/organisations you do not know very well yet. If someone is a close friend, or it is an organisation that we've been working with for a long time, you might want to consider deviating from the script.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The scripts consists of the following elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>&nbsp;‚òéÔ∏è Before the call: </strong>Preparing the conversation.</li>
  <li><strong>üëã Introduction: </strong>Getting to know each other</li>
  <li>üåä <strong>Learning about their movement: </strong>Showing interest, finding out what kind of organisation they are.</li>
  <li><strong>üôå Present Activist Handbook partnerships: </strong>Introducing our project, explaining how we can work together.</li>
  <li>‚ù§Ô∏è <strong>Working together: </strong>Discussing concrete ways we can collaborate.</li>
  <li><strong>‚≠ïÔ∏è Rounding off: </strong>Leaving them with a good feeling, taking a picture for our socials.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Follow up</h1>
<p>Your conversation with (potential) partners does not end after the first video call.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>üí¨ Message after the video call.&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>We recommend you to send a follow up message immediately after the video call with a recap of everything you discussed. Even if you make notes, you might forget to This message should contain concrete next steps that the two of you will take.</p>
<p>If they agreed to promote Activist Handbook on their <strong>social media</strong>, this is a template message you can share with them:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We're excited to announce that we're starting a collaboration with Activist Handbook, the Wikipedia for rebels! Check out their platform:<br>üëâ <a href="https://activisthandbook.org/">https://activisthandbook.org/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here's a template message for their website:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2><strong>‚òëÔ∏è Reminder message for next steps.</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>‚òéÔ∏è Yearly check-in video call.&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>We recommend you to check in with all our partners at least once a year .</p>
