<p><strong>This is a guide for Rebel Hub coordinators. In this article, you will learn what Rebel Hubs are and how to start one.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>In this guide, we assume you have already signed up as hub coordinator. If you haven't done so yet, <a href="https://airtable.com/shrKluWk3KV8d4I0E">apply as a hub coordinator</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>What is a Rebel Hub?</h1>
<p>A Rebel Hub is a local community of activists and rebel trainers. They are part of our international network of Rebel Hubs.</p>
<p>A Rebel Hub trains change-makers and collects the knowledge and experiences of activists in their city or country. Because activism is different in every country, we are writing guides about activism in different local contexts. They support existing movements and help organise campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our train-the-trainer programme, you will learn how to train activists from experienced campaigners around the globe.</p>
<p>You can start a Rebel Hub with a small group of people. We recommend to start with 2 coordinators.</p>
<h1>Start a Rebel Hub</h1>
<p>In this section, you will learn how to set up a Rebel Hub in your city or country.</p>
<h2>1. Follow training programme</h2>
<p>Most importantly: know that you are not alone in this. Experienced activists from around the globe will help you get started. We have an extensive training programme for people who want to start a Rebel Hub.</p>
<p>Our idea is simple: instead of training activists directly, we train trainers. This way, we create an accelerating chain reaction and make maximum impact. By following our academy, you will learn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to <strong>build a local community</strong> of activists and trainers</li>
  <li>How to <strong>organise</strong> and <strong>facilitate</strong> a 2-day writing event as part of the International Rebel Assembly, to collect the experiences and knowledge of activists in your community</li>
  <li>How to <strong>grow &amp; strengthen your hub</strong> so you can make long-lasting impact</li>
  <li>How to <strong>set up a training programme </strong>and<strong> support activist campaigns.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We have the following training sessions planned:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Training 1: Building the Wikipedia for activists (1 day)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Training 2: Promotion &amp; outreach (1 day)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Training 3: Writing for rebels (1 day)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Training 4: Group facilitation (1 day)</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Build a local community</h2>
<p><strong>Set up communication channels:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a <a href="/communication/chat-apps">WhatsApp group chat</a></li>
  <li><a href="/tools/social-media">Create social media accounts</a> on Facebook and Instagram.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Start your outreach campaign:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Reach out to friends</li>
  <li>Reach out to local activists movements (<a href="/organising/coalition-building">coalition building</a>, <a href="/organising/outreach-mobilisation">outreach &amp; mobilisation</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recruit volunteers:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Set up roles and share vacancies. For example, set up roles to define who will do social media, outreach, logistics,</li>
  <li>Welcome and train new people (<a href="/organising/knowledge-sharing">knowledge sharing</a>)</li>
  <li>Organise community building events to get to know each other. For example, join each other for dinner, go for a hike and get to know each other better by discussing different working styles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Join the International Rebel Assembly</h2>
<p>In July, we are organising an <a href="/rebelassembly">International Rebel Assembly</a>. During this 2-day event, activists will be coming together in local Rebel Hubs across the globe. Together, we will be writing guides for activists.</p>
<p>You only need a small group to join the Rebel Assembly. For example, you can just get together with 5 people in a living room.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Choose themes you want to write about.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Recruit participants.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Find a location to host your Rebel Hub. </strong>For example, get together in someones living room, at university, the library or community centre. If you cannot find a location for free, you might have to rent a space.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Grow &amp; strengthen your hub</h1>
<p>The International Rebel Assembly is just the beginning.</p>
