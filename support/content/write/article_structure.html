<p><strong>Within this article we will explain the basic contents that (ideally) every article on the website is following. These guidelines make sure our chapters are well structured and easy to navigate. We want our readers to familiarize with Activist Handbook easily</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This page is a domain of the <a href="/en/support/content/moderator">Content Moderator</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>Page template&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Every article should contain the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Title:</strong> should be short and clearly announce what the article is about. We strongly advise you not to make it a sentence or a question and to keep it under 30 characters. (Ex:<strong> </strong><i><strong>Article Structure</strong></i>)</li>
  <li><strong>Subtitle: </strong>The subtitle should contain additional keywords that people might search for when looking for the article. But remember that the subtitle is not just for search engine optimisation, it also has to be relevant for website visitors. (Ex: <i><strong>This is how we structure articles on the website</strong></i>)</li>
  <li><strong>Short introduction in bold (required). </strong>The introduction should outline the contents of the page.explain what the page is about and why it might (not) be relevant for the reader. Recommended length for the introduction is one paragraph.</li>
  <li><strong>Short introduction not in bold:</strong> Underneath the first part of the introduction, you should illustrate what the page is about using examples, a short engaging story or something similar. Should be max 6 lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Encourage people to contribute to the page.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Subtopics (bullet list):</strong> If there are any subtopics of the page, make sure to add a list directly underneath the introduction. Subtopics always use the following linking structure "activishandbook.org/main-topic/sub-topic".</li>
  <li><strong>Content of page</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Footnotes: </strong>When you do not want to obstruct the main content with a comment, you can add it in the footnotes.</li>
  <li><strong>Related articles (bullet list): </strong>To make it easier for activists to find the information they are looking for on this site, add a list of related articles at the bottom of each page. These articles can be from a different chapter. They should not be subtopics (as those are already in the 'subtopic' section).</li>
  <li><strong>Related resources (bullet list): </strong>Do not try to reinvent the wheel, it is very likely that someone else has already done some great work. Make it easier for your fellow activists to find relevant resources.</li>
  <li><strong>References (bullet list):</strong> A list of all recourses that are referenced in the text.</li>
</ol>
