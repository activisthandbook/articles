<p><strong>On this page, you will find all sorts of websites that contain information about activism. We put the websites that publish their content under a Creative Commons licence apart, so that we know which ones to integrate with our platform.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When adding resources, please remember that they have to be about activism in general!&nbsp;</p>
  <p>If you find a resource that is about a specific topic, please add them to a more relevant article on our website instead.</p>
