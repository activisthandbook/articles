<h1>Background: Strategy models</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>This is a background section:</strong> At Activist Handbook, we focus on writing a practical guides for activists. Sometimes, theory gets in the way of that.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To improve this section, answer the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>What are the various aspects of strategy models? (e.g. ideals, goals, theory of change, differentiation between allies/opponents)</i></li>
    <li><i>What model does Activist Handbook follow? Make sure to make clear that there is not one single model that should be used by activists.&nbsp;</i></li>
  </ul>

  <figcaption><strong>Vancouver Town Hall </strong>â€“<strong> </strong>From May 17th to the end of June, communities across Canada held over 150 town halls across the country to build a Green New Deal for Canada. A Green New Deal is an ambitious vision for tackling the climate crisis, seeing the full implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Right to Free Prior and Informed Consent and the TRC recommendations implemented, while creating millions of jobs and leaving no one behind in the process. It is a bold plan to retool our economy at the scale that science and justice demand. That means mass government investment to build a 100% renewable energy economy created safer, healthier communities for all of us.his kind of ambitious plan means a transformative policy platform that stretches across sectors and jurisdictions. And that is why we needed all hands on deck to design it.
