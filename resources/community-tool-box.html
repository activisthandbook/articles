<p><a href="https://ctb.ku.edu/en"><strong>Community Tool Box</strong></a><strong> is a large collection of guides for people who want to make a difference in their local communities.</strong></p>
<p>Why this resource is great:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Very extensive</li>
  <li>Well organised</li>
  <li>Based on academic research</li>
  <li>All licensed under Creative commons!</li>
</ul>
<p>Why this resource is not so great:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Focussed on local communities, but overlooks bigger systemic issues. Almost all strategies proposed focus on making a difference locally. While this is great for people who want to make a direct impact, it doesn't bring us closer to something like radically overhauling our toxic capitalist society.</li>
  <li>Focus on US context</li>
</ul>
