<p><strong>In this article, you will learn how to write articles that more people will find on search engines like Google. We help you get started with search engine optimisation by discussing keywords, website analytics and tools that you can use.</strong></p>
<h1>Ranking criteria</h1>
<p>The following things are taken into account by search engines like Google to determine if your webpage should show up high in the search results:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>High quality content</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Relevant topics &amp; intent</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Quality website</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Below we explain what each of these mean in detail.</p>
<h2>High quality content</h2>
<p>Google tries its best to serve people the best content. How do they know? We do not really know, their algorithm is mostly a secret. Make sure to read their own <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide">Google SEO guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short: <strong>Google does not really want to you optimise your website for Google</strong>, because that fucks up their algorithm. Instead, they want you to optimise your content for the reader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We recommend you to do exactly that: if you do not really know how to do SEO well, your best guess is just to create content that people like. Chances are that Google will like it too. These are some things that Google looks at:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Do people like your content?</strong> For example, they try to determine this by how many people are sharing links to your site. This can be other people adding a link to your website from their own site (backlinks), or people sharing your content on social media.</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content well-written? </strong>Grammar &amp; spelling mistakes</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content well organised?</strong> Headings, links,</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content unique?</strong> Brings new value to readers</li>
  <li><strong>Is your content complete? </strong>Avoid very short articles</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relevant topics &amp; intent</h2>
<p>You should <strong>write about things that people are interested in</strong>. If you want people to find your article via search engines, there is no point in writing a super high quality article about a topic that nobody looks up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>avoid too general topics</strong>. There will likely already be many articles, and it will be harder to show up high in the search results.</p>
<p>The perfect topic is frequently looked up, but no high quality articles exist about it yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google tries to figure out the <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/search-intent/"><strong>intent</strong></a> of the person typing in the search query. In other words: what result are they looking for? Those websites will show up higher in the search results.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For example, someone from Berlin looking up ‘protest today’, probably would like to read news articles about a certain protest that is happening that day in Berlin. Thus, Google will favour webpages from German news websites that have been written on that day. On the other hand, someone looking up ‘how to organise protest’ probably wants a practical guide, which is what Google will show in the results.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quality of website</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Loading time</li>
  <li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>

  <li>Google Analytics</li>
  <li>Semrush</li>
  <li>Ahref</li>
</ul>
