<p><strong>In this chapter, we discuss how you can create a strategy for your movement.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This page is an adaptation of an <a href="https://thechangeagency.org/strategy/">article</a> by The Change Agency.</p>
  <p>This chapter is a work in progress. Feel free to make suggestions on how to improve it. For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Use simpler language:</strong> shorten sentences, use less difficult words</li>
    <li><strong>Split up in sub-pages: </strong>identify key topics, and create separate pages for them.</li>
    <li><strong>Add pictures and illustrations</strong>&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>To improve this section, answer the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is a strategy?</li>
    <li>What kind of strategy models are there?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h1>Creating a strategy</h1>
<h2>Strategy models</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>To improve this section, answer the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>What are the various aspects of strategy models? (e.g. ideals, goals, theory of change, differentiation between allies/opponents)</i></li>
    <li><i>What model does Activist Handbook follow? Make sure to make clear that there is not one single model that should be used by activists.&nbsp;</i></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Writing a strategy together</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>To improve this section, answer the following questions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Practically speaking, how to I create a strategy for my movement? (document templates, guide for organising brainstorm/workshop, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Scope and goals</strong></h2>
<p>‚ÄòCut the issue‚Äô to narrow down bigger picture problems into more manageable parts. What are all the different ways the problem is experienced? How is it framed by different groups? What part of the problem or bigger issue do you intend to work on? It might be helpful to frame it as a solution or partial solution. Name the problem, identify issues and purposefully choose which one/s you plan to tackle.</p>
<p>The campaign focus might include a ‚Äòproblem statement‚Äô that defines the social or environmental justice that your group is most concerned with. What part of the problem are you trying to solve? How does resolving this issue address the underlying problem and root causes?</p>
<p>The ‚Äòcutting the issue‚Äô exercise can help you define your goals. (Note: We tend to use ‚Äògoals‚Äô as the bigger picture steps toward your vision and ‚Äòobjectives‚Äô to denote the more specific steps you are hoping to achieve along the way.) How do you want things to be? If this issue or problem is resolved, how will the situation have changed? How will justice be achieved? Objectives should be discrete and directly linked to the scope. It is generally best to focus on one campaign objective or limit to two or three. If your objectives are sufficiently different, it may be worthwhile developing separate campaign plans.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>What does the situation you are working towards look like? What does the social or environmental change that you are working on feel like when you are there? Paint yourself a picture. This helps when you‚Äôre communicating with others about the world you hope to create through your campaign or community action.</p>
<p>Two useful processes you might use are the Institute for Sustainable Communities‚Äô questions for developing your objectives and the ‚ÄòWhat is your political vision‚Äô exercise (linked below).</p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Situational analysis</strong></h2>
<p>What is the context? What political, economic, cultural or other factors are creating or maintaining this problem? What are the root causes? What factors are likely to help or hinder you in achieving your objectives? Who benefits from the problem being maintained? Who would benefit from it being changed? Are certain groups experiencing these injustices more than others? What are civil society groups doing about the situation?</p>

<h2>Stakeholders (opponents/constituents/target)</h2>
<p>When you map out the stakeholders in your campaign,&nbsp;<strong>allies</strong>&nbsp;are the stakeholders you can work with, build alliances with, and share resources with.&nbsp;<strong>Constituents</strong>&nbsp;are ‚Äúthe community‚Äù: the people you want to side with your position and help apply pressure to your target. Your&nbsp;<strong>target</strong>&nbsp;is often a decision maker: someone who can give you the change you want. In representative democracies these are often politicians, ministers, or members of parliament. Sometimes we have limited capacity to influence our primary targets, so it can useful to identify secondary targets: stakeholders who have more direct influence with the primary target. If your primary target is the CEO of a corporation, then your secondary targets might include shareholders.</p>
<p>A power map can be a useful reference and shared analysis during a campaign. This is a simple tool to identify where key stakeholders (allies, targets, opponents and constituents) stand in relation to your campaign objective, and their relative levels of influence.</p>

  <figcaption><strong>Vancouver Town Hall </strong>‚Äì<strong> </strong>From May 17th to the end of June, communities across Canada held over 150 town halls across the country to build a Green New Deal for Canada. A Green New Deal is an ambitious vision for tackling the climate crisis, seeing the full implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Right to Free Prior and Informed Consent and the TRC recommendations implemented, while creating millions of jobs and leaving no one behind in the process. It is a bold plan to retool our economy at the scale that science and justice demand. That means mass government investment to build a 100% renewable energy economy created safer, healthier communities for all of us.his kind of ambitious plan means a transformative policy platform that stretches across sectors and jurisdictions. And that is why we needed all hands on deck to design it.
