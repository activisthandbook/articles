<p><strong>On this page, you will learn how to organise a mini hackathon. You only need 3 people or more who want to meet up physically for 2 or 3 days to work on something cool, and it only takes 2 hours to organise</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Organise it in 2 hours</strong></h1>
<h2>Step 1: Get 3+ people together</h2>
<p>Meet with all people who want to join this mini hackathon. You can meet virtually or physically, but we recommend to do whatever can be arranged the fastest (so probably virtually).</p>
<p>Don't overthink it, if not everyone can join, just meet with the rest. It will be easier to organise if you can get everyone together all at once though!</p>
<h2>Step 2: Appoint meeting roles</h2>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A facilitator: </strong>This person will give people the floor to speak and indicate when we move from one agenda point to the next.</li>
  <li><strong>A scribe: </strong>this person is responsible for taking minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, make sure there is a single person responsible for each of these:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Location</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Date</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Topic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During the meeting, they will ensure their responsibility is covered. They will also take any necessary steps after the meeting related to their responsibility.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Set a date</h2>
<p><strong>First</strong>, determine within which timeframe (2-4 weeks) you want to organise the mini hackathon.</p>
<p><strong>Secondly,</strong> ask everyone to open their agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Thirdly,</strong>&nbsp;</p>
