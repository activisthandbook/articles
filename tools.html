<h1>Our honest approach</h1>
<p>We only recommend tools that we actually like to use. We are not being payed to promote any services. We ask everyone who adds items to our collection to stay objective and review the tools with a critical mindset. Any spam or promotional contributions will be removed. However, if you have developed a useful tool for activists yourself, feel free to share it with us!</p>
<p>As most activist organisations do not have access to large funds, we prefer free and open source services over payed ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we like to see that the products that we use reflect the positive impact we are trying to make on this world. In other words: we do not only assess the quality of the tools that we review, but we also try to look at the people and organisations behind the tools.</p>
