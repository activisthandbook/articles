<p><strong>In this article, you will learn how to apply for grants to support your cause. We have made a list of grants for nonprofit organisations and activist movements.</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of grants available for activists who are working to make a difference in their communities. These grants can provide funding for a variety of activities, including community organising, advocacy and international collaboration. Grants can be a great way to support the work of activists, and there are a number of organisations that provide grant funding for activists.</p>
