<p><strong>People all over the world protest for affordable housing. On Activist Handbook, you can find resources on how to organise yourself effectively.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Example: Dutch housing protests</strong></h1>
<p>There is a huge shortage in affordable housing in the Netherlands. In 2021, over 8000 people in <a href="https://woonopstand.nl/en/">Rotterdam</a> protested for affordable housing. After the protests, several municipalities announced they would start requiring people to live in the houses they buy, to counter slumlords (‘zelfwoonplicht’).</p>
<h1>Resources for housing activists</h1>

Become getting right into it by organising a housing protest, we recommend you to think about your <a href="/strategy">long term strategy</a>.</p>
