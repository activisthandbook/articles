<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>You and your hub participants will be writing articles for Activist Handbook or improving existing articles. During today’s training sessions, we will talk about what content we’re looking for in our website while explaining more about the organisation that we follow in Activist Handbook, we will also give you some tips on how to write good guides and articles. <i>Today’s training will be </i>divided<i> into four parts:&nbsp;</i></p>
<ol>
  <li><i>First, we’ll talk about <strong>Activist Handbook content, </strong>what kind of articles we write on our website, and of course</i>,<i> we will show you some examples so you can fully understand. We will also talk in this part about our approach in reusing existing resources.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>We will then talk about <strong>Chapter organisation, </strong>this part is basically about how we organise the content </i>on<i> our website in various chapters, and we’ll go through each chapter individually.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>After that, we will discuss <strong>How we can write good articles </strong>for activists by using </i>well-structured<i> sections to organise our ideas while writing.&nbsp;</i></li>
  <li><i>And for writing good articles, you definitely need some materials, and that’s what our 4th part </i>is <i>about, we will go through all the<strong> </strong></i><strong>materials</strong><i><strong> that we provide </strong>for you and for the participants of your hub. And to start working concretely, we will give you a <strong>practice writing exercise.&nbsp;</strong></i></li>
</ol>
<p><i>And to conclude our training, we will do a <strong>Reflection round </strong>&amp; talk about the <strong>Next steps </strong>that are waiting for us.</i></p>
<h1>Activist Handbook content</h1>
<p>So in this first part of the training, we will talk about what kind of articles we publish on Activist Handbook. We will also discuss how exactly all our articles are organised into chapters.</p>
<p><strong>So to get started: what kind of articles will we write during the International Rebel Assembly?</strong></p>
<p><i>✅ </i>We write<strong> <u>practical guides</u> for activists. </strong>So how do you know if your article is a practical guide for activists? Well, they usually answer a question that starts with ‘how to…’. So if you are brainstorming about what kind of articles to write, always start with the question ‘how to…’. For example: how to organise a campaign, how to reach more people with my Facebook page, and how to get funding for my activist movement.</p>
<p><strong>We do not write:</strong></p>
<p>❌ Opinion or advocacy essays. For example: I think we should introduce a carbon tax.</p>
<p>❌ Inspirational interviews. For example: Blogs or personal stories.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We are all activists. The people reading Activist Handbook are all activists. We already know that there is a lot of injustice in our society. We don’t need more motivation to act. We need <u>practical</u> advice that helps us make a positive impact. Chapter organisation</li>
</ul>
<p>So <strong>who are we writing for? </strong>We write for <u>all</u> change-makers</p>
<ul>
  <li>We do not write specifically for one cause:<br>❌ Climate activists<br>❌ Human rights activists<br>❌ Women's rights activists</li>
  <li>“To clarify, we do write guides for climate activists, for human rights activists, for women’s rights activists. But just not for those causes individually. Instead, we try to write guides that are useful for as many activists as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is really important that all of us understand what kind of articles we want to publish on Activist Handbook. So we have provided a few examples that should help you. But if you are not sure if your article ideas would be suitable for Activist Handbook, send us a message.</p>
<p><strong>Example: climate</strong></p>
<p>✅&nbsp; How to organise a protest</p>
<p>✅&nbsp; How to use social media effectively</p>
<p>✅&nbsp; How to deal with climate depression</p>
<p>❌&nbsp; How to stop the climate crisis → <i>too general, you would never be able to write a practical comprehensive guide about this topic.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>❌&nbsp; Facts about the climate crisis → <i>it’s not a how-to guide for activists</i></p>
<p>❌&nbsp; I joined a climate protest yesterday →<i> it’s a personal story. Instead, it’d be better to share any lessons you learned being at that protest in our general guide on how to organise a protest</i></p>
<p><strong>Example: women's rights</strong></p>
<p>✅&nbsp; How to make my movement inclusive</p>
<p>✅&nbsp; How to empower women in my movement</p>
<p>✅&nbsp; Sexism &amp; sexual harassment in activism</p>
<p>❌&nbsp; Why women's rights are important → <i>People reading the handbook are progressive activists, they already know that women’s rights are important. Instead, talk about what practical things they can do to protect women’s rights.</i></p>
<p>❌&nbsp; I want abortion to be protected by law → <i>Again, instead talk about what practical things activists could do to advocate the cause that they’re fighting about.</i></p>
<p>❌&nbsp; Politicians should listen more to women →<i> Politicians are not reading the handbook, activists are. Instead write about how activists can make politicians listen to them.</i></p>
<p><strong>Example: poverty</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Share screen: example poverty</strong></li>
  <li>✅&nbsp; How to organise crowdfunding</li>
  <li>✅&nbsp; How to apply for subsidy</li>
  <li>✅&nbsp; Free digital tools for activists</li>
  <li>❌&nbsp; The rich should pay more taxes → <i>Well, cool, I agree, but this doesn’t fit in the handbook. Instead talk about how we can make that happen as activists.</i></li>
  <li>❌&nbsp; I want more affordable housing → <i>Same story, talk instead about what activists can do</i></li>
  <li>❌&nbsp; Why a basic income is a good idea</li>
  <li><strong>New vs improve</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Share screen: new vs improve</strong></li>
      <li><i>So another really important thing to know about writing for Activist Handbook is the following: you do not have to write new articles, you can also improve existing articles.&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>A lot of us are used to having to write papers for school, starting with a blank page. We think that is stupid. We think it is way more efficient to build upon the work that other people have been doing.&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>So if you have a topic that you want to write about that is not on Activist Handbook yet, then of course, fine, you can create a new article. But if there is already an article about the topic, we recommend you to improve that one instead. So all of our articles have a section that is called ‘Improve this page’. In that section, you will find some advice on how you can improve that page.</i></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><u>Paulina</u>: Reuse the work of others</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Share screen: reuse work others</strong></li>
      <li><i>And speaking of improving the work of others: even if there is no article about a certain topic on Activist Handbook, there might still be many other articles written on other websites, books or videos about the topic.</i></li>
      <li><i>And we encourage you to reuse that work as well, and incorporporate, include it in your article. You can do research online, and then add the most useful information to your article as well.&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>However, there is one problem: usually, articles have copyright. This means that you cannot just copy text from those articles into your own, because of legal reasons. Luckily, there is a solution to this problem: the creative commons licence.&nbsp;</i></li>
      <li><i>So what is a Creative Commons licence? Well, the author of an article decide that they want to publish their work under a creative commons licence. And if they do that, it means that everyone can reuse their work without any problems. Underneath their article, they will write something like ‘this article is available under a creative commons licence. If you see that the writer has done that, then you can just copy and paste their work into your article. You only have to credit the original author, by saying in your own article that you reused their work.</i></li>
      <li><i>So let me show you an example of an article that is available under a creative commons licence:</i>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Share screen</strong>: <a href="https://commonslibrary.org/elections-and-activism-concepts-and-tensions/"><u>https://commonslibrary.org/elections-and-activism-concepts-and-tensions/</u></a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><i>And like I said before, make sure to credit the original author, in the attribution section of our website. I will also show you an example of what that looks like</i>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Share screen</strong>:<br><a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/tools/facebook-groups"><u>https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/tools/facebook-groups</u></a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><u>Joppe</u>: Writing in your hub</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Share screen: writing in your hub</strong></li>
      <li><i>So how will this writing process work during the Rebel Assembly?</i></li>
      <li><i>The first step is to explain to your hub participants how to write good articles. You will share what we shared with you today with your hub participants. We will prepare materials for you that will help you train your hub participants.</i></li>
      <li><i>The next step is to divide your hub into small groups. About 2-3 people can work on the same article.</i></li>
      <li><i>The third step is to divide the work so that everyone works on something else.&nbsp; We recommend you to do it this way, because that way everyone is able to contribute, and everyone will be able to be proud of what they worked on afterwards.</i></li>
      <li><strong>Chat: </strong>Do you think that you’ll be able to explain our writing process within your hub?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><u>Joppe</u>: Conclusion</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><i>So that concludes the first part of this training. We talked about what kind of content we want to publish on Activist Handbook. In the next part, we will be talking about how we organise all our content on our website.</i></li>
