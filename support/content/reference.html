<p>When writing articles, we might want to explain certain concepts, use of words, or stress a caveat. You can use either asterisk (*) or numbers (1) (2) … (n) in case you will be using multiple footnotes. The related footnotes are placed at the bottom of the main article, before chapters and other links in the section titled “Footnotes”. Examples can be found in the articles <a href="/en/getting-started"><i>Introduction </i></a>and <a href="/en/wellbeing/riot-medicine/field-guide"><i>Riot Medicine.</i></a></p>
<p>When quoting external resources such as papers, articles, videos or podcasts we use the following format</p>
<p><strong>Name of the content, [language, type of content] by Author (year of publication)</strong></p>
<p>Link to the original content are placed within the name of the content. The references are placed at the very bottom of the article, after the footnotes and other links, in the section titled “References”. Examples can be found in the article <a href="/en/getting-started"><i>Introduction</i></a>.</p>
