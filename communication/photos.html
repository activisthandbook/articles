<p><strong>Guide to help photographers prepare for an action or event</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Started by Chelsea, Sam and Rachelle | <a href="https://leard.frontlineaction.org/">Leard Blockade</a></p>

<h1>Day/Night Before Action</h1>
<h2>Prepare gear</h2>
<ul>
  <li>camera-set to raw and jpg (or just jpg)</li>
  <li>lenses (wide, mid-zoom, and telephoto)</li>
  <li>batteries-charged</li>
  <li>Memory cards</li>
  <li>laptop-charged and has appropriate software</li>
  <li>card reader</li>
  <li>internet dongle-charged and has credit</li>
  <li>phone-charged and with credit</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the phone coverage of the area you will be in. Will your phone/dongle work where you will be photographing?<br>Read and pack a copy of the Street Photographers Guide. This will help you understand your rights while taking photographs.</p>
<h2>Take portrait of the action participant.</h2>
<ul>
  <li>having more than one option is best (ie. smiling and serious)</li>
  <li>upload and resize</li>
  <li>give portrait to media team</li>
</ul>
<h2>Buddy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Check out the “<a href="https://actionskills.co/resource/action-photo-coordinator/">Action Photo Coordinator</a>” document</li>
  <li>Work out with your buddy how you plan to work together.</li>
  <li>Does your buddy know the software you plan to use</li>
  <li>Your buddy’s job is to assist you while photographing so you can get as many good shots as circumstances will allow. &nbsp;Discuss with your buddy what your expectations are and vice versa. This will make for smooth running at the action.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the jobs you might want your buddy to do are listed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>people wrangling</li>
  <li>carrying gear</li>
  <li>uploading images</li>
  <li>selecting images</li>
  <li>resizing images</li>
  <li>metadata</li>
  <li>sending images to media team</li>
</ul>
<h1>Day of Action</h1>
<p>Double check you have all your gear before you leave camp</p>
<h2>At Action</h2>
<p>As soon as everything is in place, get key shots–you never know how long you will have before you aren’t able to photograph anymore (police move you on, etc.)</p>
<h2>Recommended Shots</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Wide shot of action</li>
  <li>portrait of participant in place</li>
  <li>group shot if there are supporters (with banners etc)</li>
  <li>make sure everyone is on the same page (all smiling or all green steel, etc.)</li>
  <li>side areas/supporting shots (ie, trucks backed up, workers waiting, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upload (Onsite)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>(have another memory card in the camera so you can continue to shoot)</li>
  <li>JPG, resize to 1500px across, SRGB, high quality compression</li>
  <li>choose key shots and send them to media team-cut it back to around 6 images</li>
  <li>keep shooting when police/police rescue arrive (shoot as much as possible before they get a chance to tell you to stop shooting. But try to remain discreet.)</li>
  <li>upload second lot of photos after police presence after re-send another 6 or so to media team again.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Back at camp</h2>
<ul>
  <li>go through all photos- pick your best (up to around 30), these should give a good run down of the whole action.</li>
  <li>give full resolution jpgs (AND RAW if available) to picture desk.</li>
  <li>return all borrowed equipment to it’s original place (ie, dongle, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h1>General Notes</h1>
<ul>
  <li>A long lens can really help you to keep photographing after police have asked you to move along but try to be discreet about it!</li>
</ul>
