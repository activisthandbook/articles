<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Subject: Let's work together, &lt;organisation/name&gt;! üì¢</strong></p>

<p>If you are reaching out to them via a private message, we recommend to keep it shorter:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hey &lt;name&gt;, I'm &lt;name&gt; from Activist Handbook. We are building a Wikipedia-like platform for activists all over the world to exchange knowledge and experiences. We would love to work together with &lt;organisation&gt;!<br><br><i>How about we schedule a video call sometime soon, so we can get to know each other a bit &amp; talk about how we could join forces?&nbsp;</i></p>

<blockquote>

<h1>Script video call partners</h1>
<p>There is a <a href="https://forms.gle/CzJoF95HhpppNG5J8"><strong>partnership script</strong></a> that you can follow during a video call with potential partners. Simply follow the instructions in the form and fill in any answers that the representative of the organisation may give. A call takes about 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is recommended to go through the form and practice with someone else before using it with one of our potential partners.</li>
    <li>The script is written for conversations with people/organisations you do not know very well yet. If someone is a close friend, or it is an organisation that we've been working with for a long time, you might want to consider deviating from the script.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The scripts consists of the following elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>&nbsp;‚òéÔ∏è Before the call: </strong>Preparing the conversation.</li>
