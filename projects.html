<h1>Ongoing</h1>
<h2>Highlighted pages</h2>
<p>Here you can find the individual pages of ongoing projects that will serve as an interactive online dashboard. You can follow the progress of projects by phases, see announcements for public events or other forms of contribution.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/academy/web-dev"><strong>Web development course for rebels</strong></a>: We teach activists the basics of web development.</li>
  <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mGicQGPIqF35goMQ6K8Z5MKxfuK2nU4-gf3L3PRxg_g/edit#"><strong>Constitution of Activist Handbook</strong></a>: We are writing a document that defines what the Activist Handbook project is about, what we stand for, and how we are organised.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project working docs</h2>
<p>Every project at Activist Handbook has a <i>project working doc</i>. In these documents you will find a project proposal and timeline that is constantly updated. Keep in mind that some are in pre-preparatory phase and are not guaranteed to be realised in the near future (in other words: be moved back to the ideas category).</p>
