# Installations
This week, you will use the Vue CLI to create a new Vue project. First, you will need to [install the Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) globally.

Installing something globally, means that you do not just install it inside a certain directory, for example your project folder, but make it available on your entire computer.

- **Step 1:** [Install the Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) globally using this command:
```yarn global add @vue/cli```. 
- **Step 2:** Navigate to the right folder in your terminal and run the following command to create a new project: 
```vue create my-project```.
- **Step 3:** To start a development server, run the following command *inside your project directory*: 
```vue serve```
