<p><strong>Blueprints for Change is a collection of high-quality guides for activists. They provide practical ‘how to’ guides for social change-makers, to help movements organise and plan more effectively. Their guides are a valuable asset for campaigners. In our resources chapter, you can find similar </strong><a href="/resources/websites"><strong>websites for protestors</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>We added the following resources from the <a href="https://blueprintsfc.org/guides/">Blueprints for Change</a> website to Activist Handbook:&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>Difference Blueprints for Change and Activist Handbook</strong></h1>
<p>Guides published by Blueprints for Change are written by a group of experienced campaigners, and are always peer-reviewed. This means that their resources usually provide very detailed and qualitative insights into activist tactics. Activist Handbook, on the other hand, takes a more Wikipedia-style approach, making it more accessible for a large number of people to contribute. This results in a wider range of topics that are covered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another difference is the platform used to publish content. Blueprints for Change uses Google Docs, which are harder to find using search engines. At Activist Handbook, we use specialised wiki software, specifically developed for collaborative knowledge exchange.</p>
<h1>A reusable resource</h1>
<p>Blueprints for Change has published all their articles for activists under a Creative Commons licence, just like Activist Handbook. This means that change-makers can redistribute and make adaptations to their work, which we think is awesome!</p>
<p>Thanks to this approach, we were able to publish their resources on Activist Handbook as well.</p>
