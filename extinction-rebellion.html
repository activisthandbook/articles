<p><strong>Extinction Rebellion</strong> (abbreviated as <strong>XR</strong>) is a global environmental movement with the stated aim of using nonviolent civil disobedience to compel government action to avoid tipping points in the climate system, biodiversity loss, and the risk of social and ecological collapse.</p>
<p>Extinction Rebellion (XR) is an international eco-socialist movement that uses nonviolent civil disobedience to campaign for zero carbon emissions, an end to the ecological crisis, and social and economic justice. The group has been active in over 60 countries and has been described as "the fastest growing climate movement in history".&nbsp;<br><br>Founded in the UK in 2018, XR's central demand is for the UK government to "Tell the Truth" about the scale of the climate and ecological emergency, declare a climate and ecological emergency, act to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, and create and be led by a Citizens' Assembly on climate and ecological justice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XR's protests have included occupations of public spaces, including roads and bridges; disruptive actions at major airports; and blockades of government buildings. The group has also targeted companies that they see as contributing to the climate crisis, such as investment banks, oil and gas companies, and automakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XR has been criticised for causing disruption to the lives of ordinary people, and for not doing enough to engage with groups who are most vulnerable to climate change. The group has also been accused of being "self-indulgent" and "privileged", and of having a "white, middle-class" membership.&nbsp;</p>
