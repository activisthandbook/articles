<p><strong>This chapter is meant as a guide on how to safeguard the wellbeing of activists. In the process of trying to make a change, you might forget about your own wellbeing. You will learn how why the wellbeing of you and your fellow change-makers is vital for the long term effectiveness of your movement.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>You can contribute: </strong>Whatever your experiences as activist are, they are valid and deserve to be heard. We want to provide the opportunity for people all over the world to share exchange their experiences. This way we can learn from each other and find comfort in our welcoming community.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Please make sure to treat each other with respect and dignity. You are free to share your experiences anonymously, if that makes you feel more comfortable. Find out more about <a href="/join">how to contribute</a>.</p>

<h1>Introduction&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Many activists struggle with their mental and physical health, or see how the wellbeing of fellow change-makers is affected by activism. You might experience stress because you feel your contributions do not create any significant change. You might feel disappointed with yourself for not doing enough, or you feel helpless because others are not doing enough. You might fear being infiltrated by police or oppositional activists groups, and are not sure anymore who to trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This chapter is about acknowledging those difficulties and providing help for those who need it. In addition, we will talk about how to prevent mental and physical health issues. As so well put by H√•kan Geijer: ‚ÄúBe gentle with each other so we can be dangerous together.‚Äù</p>
<h1><strong>Time Management</strong></h1>
<h2>How to organize passion projects and life obstacles</h2>
<p>In this article, you will learn how to manage your time as an activist. The advice in this guide will help you prevent burning out. We will talk about how to create a schedule and tips for developing the proper mindset when it comes to managing what you do with your time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Focus</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Find a better way to organise this chapter. These are some themes that could perhaps help us organise the chapter:<ul>
      <li>Health</li>
      <li>Culture</li>
      <li>Inclusion</li>
      <li>Community</li>
      <li>Spirituality</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Write about activist burnout, it's by far the most searched keyword</li>
  <li>Collect the most valuable resources on climate anxiety</li>
  <li>Make wellbeing guides more science-based (perhaps interview psychologists that have experience with activism?)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Search keywords</h2>
<p>We have not been able to find many high performing search keywords yet, except for ‚Äòactivism burnout‚Äô. More general wellbeing related keywords like ‚Äòactive listening‚Äô receive more searches, but are not relevant enough for Activist Handbook to show up high in the results. ‚ÄòClimate anxiety‚Äô also scores high, but lots of reliable resources already exist, so again hard to show up high.</p>
