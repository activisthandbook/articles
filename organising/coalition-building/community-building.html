<p>How to activate and engage activist members.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you build rapport and friendship among your project volunteers? There are always questions about how to get to know the volunteers more. You ask yourself, “Is there something I should do to fill in the time between deadlines?” How can the project facilitator construct efforts to be fun and not like a job?</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Building Communication</strong></h1>
<p>A project facilitator must ensure communication so that the entire group can run smoothly and effectively.</p>
<h2>One-on-One Meetings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>One on one meetings, although they might seem unnecessary, are essential for team-building and making sure everyone on your team is on the same page as you, the director</li>
  <li>It will allow for the members to bring up any specific questions or personal concerns they may have</li>
  <li>It will even provide an opportunity for a professional friendship to blossom</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><strong>Building Connection</strong></h1>
<p>Hosting traditions and fun activities that promote community bonding can shift a group from a staff of disengaged volunteers to friends.</p>
<h2>Ice-Breakers</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ice-breakers are definitely a way for project members to get to know each other<ul>
      <li>the benefit to members getting to know each other is that it becomes less like a bunch of strangers with a common interest, and more like a bond between people working towards a common goal</li>
      <li>As can be inferred, having a bond among your members will encourage volunteers to work more cohesively as a unit, rather than a bunch of different pieces working at their own pace</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Games</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Like icebreakers, games are meant to bring a group of people together</li>
  <li>There are several games that work in an online setting so location and international groups won’t be a problem</li>
  <li>Game examples:<ul>
      <li>Garctic Telephone</li>
      <li>…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Traditions&nbsp;</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Not only are slogans fun, but they build an identity in the project</li>
  <li>Everyone wants to be a part of a community that has an identity. Building that identity…</li>
  <li>Ways to welcome new people</li>
  <li>Ways to celebrate when we reach a certain goal</li>
  <li>Dinners</li>
</ul>
