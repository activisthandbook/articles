<p><strong>The book Deep Green Resistance is a manifesto for environmental activists, arguing for a more confrontational and aggressive approach to defending the planet from the threats of climate change and environmental destruction.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The authors call for a "deep green resistance" to achieve this, which involves building grassroots networks of activists who are willing to take direct action to protect the environment. They argue that the current approach of relying on governments and corporations to address environmental concerns has failed, and that a new, more radical strategy is needed.</p>
