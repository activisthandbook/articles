<h1>In short</h1>
<p>No-one is born an activist. And our education system certainly does not tell us how to rebel. So let's write a handbook together.</p>
<p><strong>We are so done with this shitfuckery. It is time to train rebels and uproot the system. </strong>Real people need real practical help in their fight against injustice. No more blah blah blah. At the International Rebel Assembly, we do not write articles just for the sake of writing articles. We want to bring about real change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event is an intense, sprint-like team work activity that lasts for only 2 days, and produces clear written outputs. All your work will be added to Activist Handbook, the Wikipedia for rebels.</p>
