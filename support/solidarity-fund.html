<p><strong>Contribute to the Activist Handbook solidarity fund to help make our project accessible to everyone. Volunteers and supporters all chip in with whatever they can afford to give.</strong></p>

<h1>How we use the solidarity fund</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>‚ù§Ô∏è Make activism accessible to everyone:</strong> We want to include the experiences of activists around the globe in our handbook. But not everyone can afford to work as a volunteer, or even to pay for the required internet connection. Your donation makes our organisation more inclusive.</li>
  <li><strong>üåç Connect activists around the globe:</strong> We are enabling movements around the globe to exchange knowledge on change-making. That requires us to pay for digital tools that allow us to work together internationally. And to compensate the travel costs of those who cannot afford to pay for it themselves. Your contribution brings together activists around the globe.</li>
</ul>
