<p>As your movement grows, you will likely find it becomes harder to make decisions quickly. You might lose track of who is responsible for certain tasks. You may lose motivation, because your goals seem so far out of reach. Setting up a good movement framework can help your organise better.</p>
<p>Do not reinvent the wheel: other movements have tried out many different ways of organising. Use the following frameworks to get inspired:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/organising/holacracy"><strong>Holacracy</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="/organising/sos"><strong>Self-Organising System</strong></a></li>
  <li><a href="/organising/scrum"><strong>Scrum</strong></a></li>
</ul>
