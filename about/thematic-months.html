<h1>About this project</h1>
<p>Thematic Months is a monthly project where we focus on one Activist Handbook Chapter per month. During the month, participants write articles on the topic(s) related to the theme of the month, there's a video recorded discussion and other activities such as a workshop or a casual get-together. We invite people and organisations who are interested in these themes. This would be a great opportunity to collaborate with like-minded changemakers. We would be delighted to have you onboard for this project.</p>
