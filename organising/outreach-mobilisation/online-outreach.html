<h1>Social Media: How to get the world to learn about your project</h1>
<p>This becomes the face of your project and your movement.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Discord</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>An introduction to discord: Discord is a worldwide platform where users can make certain servers and invite others to chat.</li>
  <li>Discord is primarily used by groups to build a community around certain interests or established relationships.<ul>
      <li>Because Discord’s way of doing things is for users to find servers based on their interests, there are a lot of ways an organization can utilize Discord as a way to promote their project.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Avenue 1: The primary way people use Discord for their groups is by creating a server of their own.<ul>
      <li>“The best way to promote your brand on Discord is to build a business-specific community server, along with different related channels for conversation. You can then invite users to join, have them find you organically through browsing the platform, or promote it on your other social channels and in marketing materials.”<ul>
          <li><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/discord-advertising#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20promote,channels%20and%20in%20marketing%20materials"><u>https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/discord-advertising#:~:text=The%20best%20way%20to%20promote,channels%20and%20in%20marketing%20materials</u></a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>There are several ways you can get your services out there by either listing your server on the server listings or hosting public events.</li>
      <li>Having a server is like having a home base for your activist project. It’s not only a way of promotion, but it’s a great way to organize.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Avenue 2: Outreach via Discord can be done well by engaging people in other servers related to your interests. For example, if your activist project is a youth-run project about art and climate change, then you can promote your project on a server that talks about a broad server about climate change.<ul>
      <li>There are two things you need to make sure of before you promote:<ul>
          <li>One is that you have permission to promote your project on the server. Second, you have to make sure you explain why your organization is different from the server you’re currently promoting in. To illustrate, if your small project is specifically for youths about art and climate change, then it’d be good to promote in a large server about climate change in general. Be sure to say “ATTENTION ALL ARTISTIC ACTIVISTS FROM AGES 13-20!” So that those in your member demographic will see that first and be like: “Oh, that’s me! This sounds interesting.”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Reddit</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>An introduction to Reddit: Like Discord, Reddit is another vast and worldwide community that involves a lot of niche subcommunities called “subreddits.” Such subreddits can be as general as r/pics or as niche as r/screenwriters.<ul>
      <li>Unlike Discord, Reddit is not primarily used for promotions nor as a way to organize your project. Reddit is a free-for-all site where users can visit funny memes or chat about world news.</li>
      <li>But if you utilize the power of subreddits, that is, you promote your stuff in the right community, you will be able to find members you desire.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Avenue 1: Promoting on niche subreddits is a great way of finding the desired members or audience for your activist project.<ul>
      <li>Of course, you can only promote your project after attaining permission from either the moderators or the set rules of the community to promote your project. You can find the rules on the right column of each subreddit. Failure to follow rules will usually land with your account being banned and your promotion deleted. After you’re sure you’re allowed to promote on that subreddit, you can go ahead!</li>
      <li>“Choose subreddits with the most participants that are as close as possible to your promoted product or service. Usually, these subreddits have a greater potential for attracting visitors.”<ul>
          <li><a href="https://blog.travelpayouts.com/en/how-to-promote-on-reddit/"><u>https://blog.travelpayouts.com/en/how-to-promote-on-reddit/</u></a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Choosing to promote in niche subreddits will lower the chance that your post will get lost in the tide and increase the chance that you will attain the members or audience you crave.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Avenue 2: There are several ways to promote and one is making a post<ul>
      <li>Use keywords for optimal search</li>
      <li>Don’t make hyperlinks in your post:<ul>
          <li>“Share your blog’s name without linking it to the domain. For example, write “Travelpayouts” instead of “blog.travelpayouts.com”. Make it seem as though you are mentioning the brand for the convenience of other users and not just trying to promote it. Those who are interested will find your brand anyway while you won’t attract the negative attention of admins.”</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Post quality content:<ul>
          <li>Have an intriguing picture to connect with users</li>
          <li>Have professional (but also casual!) formatting<ul>
              <li>No grammatical errors</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Bolded and underline subsections</li>
          <li>One paragraph = one thought</li>
          <li>Using keywords</li>
          <li>Make it personal<ul>
              <li>No one wants to feel like they’re reading a promotion from a faceless organization. Write with first-person singular or collective pronouns like “I” and “We” to create that connection between you and the viewers of your post.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Avenue 3: Another way to promote is by making a comment on an already popular post<ul>
      <li>“The easiest way to get upvotes and karma is by commenting on the most popular posts, such as those featured on the front page. You can leave a separate comment or engage in current discussions, which is even more likely to earn you some karma.” (TravelPayouts)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tip: You need to make sure that as you’re promoting by comments and such, you’re attaining karma. Karma on Reddit is essential a like or an upvote you’ve gained from a post or comment you posted. Moderators usually look at how much karma you have when you post to make sure that you’re being a meaningful contributor to the community, and not just posting haphazardly.</li>
