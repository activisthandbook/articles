<p>While writing Activist Handbook we realised that each activist community also needs their own guides that apply to their specific cause. That is why we allow these communities to add your own manuals on our website.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Start writing articles by creating a new page for your community and adding it to the list below!</p>

<h1>Let's work together</h1>
<p>Activist Handbook is a non-profit organisation developed by volunteers. We depend on donations to host our website. If your organisation relies on Activist Handbook to host manuals, consider making a donation. Get in touch:&nbsp;<br><a href="mailto:contact@activisthandbook.org">contact@activisthandbook.org</a></p>
<h1>List of communities</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Many movements advocate causes that are interconnected with other issues. The categorisation pages below serve as a way to make it easier for website visitors to find the community they are looking for. Various movements are also added to multiple category pages. A movement that is added to one category, does not mean they do not care about other issues as well.&nbsp;</p>
