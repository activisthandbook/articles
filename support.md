# Guides

We know that seeing all of these guides can be a bit overwhelming. At the very least, we recommend new volunteers to read our article on [**the basics**](basics).

We try to make our organisation accessible to everyone. Read our article on [**accessibility**](accessibility) if you have trouble understanding English, technology related issues or need special facilities in order to participate.

-   [**Our organisation**](organisation)**:** We work with *circles* and *roles*. Both have clearly defined what their *purpose*, *domain* and *accountabilities* are. Read this article to find out more about who does what.
-   [**Our meetings**](meetings): We meet on a regular basis. Read this guide to find out what kind of meetings we have.
-   [**Managing projects**](managing-projects): Working on large projects effectively is hard, so we have set up a few guidelines.
