<h1>Adding resources</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Examples of correctly formatting external resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Name of article</a> by Author (2020) | <a href="#">View in archive</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Book: Name of book</a> by Author (2020)</li>
    <li><a href="#">Video: Name of video</a> [French] by Author (2020)</li>
    <li><a href="#">Name of resource</a> by Author (no date)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The first step when writing a new article is to collect resources. Resources can be external articles, books, movies, and more. Here are a few tips when collecting resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make clear what kind of resource it is</strong> by adding the type in the title. We do not usually indicate if it is an article, as this is the default.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Make clear what in what language(s) the resource is available</strong> when it is in a different language than the page it is on. Add it between brackets after the title like so: [German]</li>
  <li><strong>Make sure to archive the resource. </strong>This way, even if the original link breaks (for example, when the link changes or the page is deleted), users will still be able to access the resource. Use <a href="https://web.archive.org">web.archive.org</a> to archive web pages.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Captioning illustrations</h1>
<p>When you add an illustration you will be given an option to edit the captions at the bottom. We recommend the following format of the caption:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/cacerolazo.jpg">
  <figcaption><a href="#">Image title</a> by Author (Year)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h1>Footnotes</h1>
<p>We prefer not to use footnotes, as they make a text hard to read. However, if you still want to use them (for example if you are reusing existing work), follow these guidelines:</p>
<p>When writing articles, we might want to explain certain concepts, use of words, or stress a caveat. You can use either asterisk (*) or numbers (1) (2) … (n) in case you will be using multiple footnotes. The related footnotes are placed at the bottom of the main article, before chapters and other links in the section titled “Footnotes”. Examples can be found in the article <a href="/en/wellbeing/riot-medicine/field-guide"><i>Riot Medicine.</i></a></p>
