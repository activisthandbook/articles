# Group project
Before next Sunday, work together with your fellow students and prepare the following:
- Turn the markdown files of last week into HTML files.
- Improve the guide by looking up more info about HTML and CSS.
- Share all of this in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/activisthandbook/web-dev-course).
