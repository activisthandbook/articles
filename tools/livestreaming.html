<p><strong>As the world increasingly moves online, more and more activists are using live streaming to reach larger audiences and get their message out. While live streaming can be a great way to connect with supporters, it also comes with its own set of challenges. In this guide, we'll explore some of the best practices for live streaming as an activist, including how to reach your audience, how to stay safe online, and how to make the most of your live stream.</strong></p>
<h1><strong>Livestream setup</strong></h1>
<h2>From your phone (single camera)</h2>
<p>For YouTube, you will need to fit the <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9228390">requirements</a>. Check out the guide on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1884140525218868?id=1123223941353904">how to go live on Facebook</a>.

<h2><strong>Multiple cameras, different locations</strong></h2>
<p>If you want to live stream an event with multiple people streaming their video from different locations, you have various options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Connect to video call (easy &amp; cheap): </strong>For example, join in a Jitsi video call and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=970gdTXZXOs">connect</a> it to a Youtube Livestream (see illustration and video below).</li>
  <li><strong>Stream from streaming apps to switching software (advanced &amp; cheap): </strong>For example, record live video using <a href="https://vdo.ninja/">VDO.Ninja</a> to another computer running OBS Studio. You will need a fast computer to do this.</li>
  <li><strong>Professional live streaming software or hardware (advanced, more reliable &amp; expensive):</strong> For example, read this <a href="https://www.dacast.com/blog/simulcast-streaming/">article</a>.</li>
