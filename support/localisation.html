<p>Localisation circle is working on ways to adapt the contents of Activist Handbook to the local contexts of our readers, by translating the articles into various languages and looking for examples of activist practices in local communities. We are also aiming to strengthen local activist communities through the “<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RLC8OHYbzKo4v4UDkao27Z2NQIy5OBSc_SXs0uLqMBk/edit">Local circles</a>” project.</p>
<p>We value diversity and inclusivity, we're constantly searching for ways to bridge cultural and language gaps, we organize&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Activist Handbook, we're using <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/support/organisation">Holacracy</a>, a way of organising we're not normally used to. Make sure to get acquainted with the basics if you have trouble understanding the idea of Roles, Purpose, Domains and Accountabilities. Also feel free to contact the Tech circle coordinator if reading about it still doesn't clarify the idea.</p>

<h1>Localisation Circle Purpose</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>Localise our content and community</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We want to make sure Activist Handbook is useful everywhere, not just in the Global North. This is a challenging task that requires us to find members from various countries and adapt our articles and content to their context as well as finding what's universal about various tactics regardless of where they are being used</p>
<h1>Localisation Circle Domain</h1>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Translation</li>
    <li>Creation of Local Circles</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Groups of translators, Slack channels about translation, local groups… these are all in our domain. We're making sure people who speak same language or come from the same geopolitical areas can find each other and work together to gather and deliver content about activism that's relevant within their context.</p>
