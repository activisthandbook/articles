<h1>Shooting for news media</h1>
<p>Media agencies rarely run a story longer than 1 1/2 mins for their news feeds, so there for they do not require a lot of footage in order to edit their story.</p>
<h2>What shots to share</h2>
<p>News agencies require very generic type of shots these including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Master Establishment Shot.</li>
  <li>Close Ups of people involved in the lock on/action.</li>
  <li>Any sensational footage (security interaction, violence, police searching).</li>
  <li>Pieces to camera from the the protestors locked on, explaining why they are doing it.</li>
  <li>Cutting off the lock on by police rescue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are not sure of what video to add, quickly look at some news footage to get an idea.</p>
<p>The best thing to do following an action, and as soon as it is feasibly possible is to go through the video rushes and select between:</p>
<ul>
  <li>8-10 videos of between 10- 20 secs. &nbsp;The 10-20 secs is crucial as it allows top and tailing for the editing. &nbsp;If you have a large video file, select the best part of it that shows the story. If you have a piece to camera it can be longer, but use discretion.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t </strong>add anything that you think they will not use, and make sure you pick the best quality footage you have.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Media codecs &amp; exporting</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Don’t </strong>mix interlaced and progressive footage into the same file. &nbsp;If you have two (2) different source footage make two (2) different exports.</li>
  <li>Always export sequence footage out as exactly the same as the codec you filmed. &nbsp;If it was filmed at 1080p export as 1080p, &nbsp;if filmed as 1080i export as 1080i, if filmed as 720p export as 720p.</li>
  <li>When exporting, export as <strong>.mov</strong> <strong>NOT</strong> as <strong>.avi. </strong>It is ok to export as H.264 but in .mov file.</li>
  <li>Export with a bit rate higher than 12,000mbps (this is broadcast requirement)</li>
  <li>Place one (1) sec of black between each video file in sequence, to allow media agency to cut each section cleanly.</li>
  <li>Check audio in each file. &nbsp;If there is an audio (people speaking which is considered dubious or could be utilised in a negative way, remove audio from the video)</li>
</ul>
