<h1>Q&amp;A</h1>
<h2>Why should activists train?</h2>
<p>There are many reasons why activists might choose to train themselves. For example, they may want to learn new skills to be more effective in their work, or they may want to gain a better understanding of the issues they are fighting for. Training can also help activists to build confidence.</p>
<p>Some ways that workshops can help movements and nonprofit organisations are by providing a space to exchange knowledge and experiences, to meet other activists working on similar issues, and to plan and strategise together. Workshops can also help activist movements to learn new tools and techniques to further their work.</p>
<h2>What can I get training for?</h2>
<p>Activists could get training in a variety of topics, including but not limited to: community organizing, <a href="/organising/finance">fundraising</a>, event planning, media relations, <a href="/communication/public-speaking">public speaking</a>, and writing.</p>
<p>Experienced campaigners organise workshops for your organisation or help facilitate. They can help you to answer questions like these: how to run a successful campaign, how to use social media for campaigning, <a href="/tactics/canvassing">how to door-knock or canvass</a> for a campaign, how to plan and execute a campaign event, and how to deal with media attention during a campaign. Check out the list above with all organisations that provide these trainings.</p>
