<h1><strong>Your role</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Summary: </strong>As Tech supporter, your purpose will be to provide assistance to Activist Handbook&nbsp;volunteers who are facing tech issues, as well as to create guides regarding tech support.</p>
<p>You will also be acting as liaison and provide a helping hand for the <a href="https://rebel.tools/">Rebel Tools</a> tech sub-circle within the <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/support/tech">Tech circle</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Role definition: </strong>You can find the exact purpose, domain and accountabilities of this role in <a href="https://airtable.com/appVJ580r68oWQ6M4/tblTRJuhY3VDCNwJr/viwQ80eK0aE226gpv/recEGgaTvEJT4fmgY?blocks=hide">Airtable</a>.</p>
<h1>Common issues</h1>
<h2>Forgot password</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ask what email address they used to log in</li>
  <li>Look up their name &amp; email address in the admin view of our website. If there is none, look them up in our Slack &amp; Mailchimp, to see if they may have used another email address. If you then still cannot find the account, they probably just never created one. In that case, show them how to create an account.</li>
  <li>If you can find the account in the website admin dashboard, change the password for them (use a random password generator). Send them this password, and ask them to change it. Once they are signed in, this can be done here: <a href="https://www.activisthandbook.org/p/profile">https://www.activisthandbook.org/p/profile</a></li>
