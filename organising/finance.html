<h1>How to contribute</h1>
<p>This article still needs quite a bit of work. Here are some examples of how it could be improved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Add section describing different types of funding (crowdsourcing, project-based grants, operational grants, etc). Maybe create sub-pages, with more info on each (eg. one how to write project proposals for grants).</li>
  <li>Add more organisations to list of funding sources.</li>
  <li>Add a section about local opportunities to apply for funding (maybe split up into sub-pages, one for each country?)</li>
</ul>
