<p><strong>In this chapter, you will learn how to transform a group of individuals into a powerful movement. We will talk about how you can build capacity to make impact, how to facilitate a welcoming atmosphere for everyone, and how to set up an organisational structure for decision making.</strong></p>
<h1>Start organising</h1>
<p>You want to achieve change. But where do you start? We recommend you find likeminded people and start organising yourselves together.&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Capacity building</h1>
<p>You want to make a big impact. But you have a limited access to resources needed to get there. This section focusses on building capacity to bring about change.</p>
<p>Learn how to increase the number of people in your organisation, through activating supporters (mobilisation), activating non-supporters (recruitment), and keeping your activists active (engagement).</p>
<p>Learn how to grow knowledge in your members (training), grow the knowledge in your organisation (organisational learning), and manage that knowledge in a systemic way (knowledge management).</p>
