**The guides on this page are written specifically for volunteers in our communication circle. If you would like to read more general articles about effective communication in activism, we recommend you to read our [communications chapter](/communication)**

> The support articles are written by the volunteers in the communication circle. Make sure to improve the guide for your own role, so that someone else can take over easily.
